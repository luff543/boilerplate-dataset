html body section div div article div div p span  ,"And the need for food is never-ending, which is why shoppers see way-out-there creativity on menus that they don't see on, say, furniture showroom floors or on car dashboards.

html body section div div article div div p span  ,"""Could it be driver of earnings? Yes,"" Saleh said. ""One of the cornerstones of their same-store sales growth is beverage innovation,"" he said.
