html body div article section div p span  ,". Players have been poking and prodding the purple cube as it slowly traverses the map in search of clues, but not it's finally reached a resting place in Loot Lake, where it melted and made the entire surface a terrifying trampoline. But this is only the beginning of the Fortnite Season 6 tease. With only a few days until the big update, expect plenty more to go down at Loot Lake and elsewhere. So, tinfoil hats firmly planted on our heads, here's everything we know about Fortnite Season 6 so far, along with a bit of wild speculation.",0,8

html body div article section div p span  ,"Good question! Now we finally know it was headed to Loot Lake, where it melted into the water and left a bouncy surface, but we highly doubt weeks of anticipation and investigation were meant to amount to a trampoline. There's definitely more to come. First, a recap: If you're new to Fortnite, here's the short version of the 'story' so far.",1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"A missile launched and broke the sky. A viking village and desert and a temple dedicated to the worship of a tomato appeared out of the cracks, bringing in locations and characters from varying time periods. The space-time police weren't happy about this, and as alluded to in the description under the Enforcer skin released just last week, it's time to restore order.",1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"Order means closing the rift, which happened over the course of a few weeks and culminated in a lightning storm that eventually summoned a massive seemingly sentient cube to Fortnite's island. Little was discovered about the cube since it showed up. It was bouncy, it shot out bolts of lightning when damaged, and it was covered in strange runic symbols. It made a short pit stop every few days to print a rune into the ground and deploy a low-grav field before tipping into Loot Lake and melting. Many of the same properties of the cube now apply to Loot Lake.",1,8

html body div article section div p a span  ,Epic has announced,1,9
html body div article section div p span  ,"the official start date of Fortnite Season 6 as September 27, just one day after the one-year anniversary of the launch of Fortnite Battle Royale. Take a look at the first teaser below, a robotic llama DJ. I'm totally lost too.",1,8
html body div article section div h3 span  ,What will the theme of Fortnite Season 6 be?,1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"I'm guessing worlds will continue to collide, but not via cracks in time this go-round. The first teaser points to a party theme, or possibly a future where llamas rule the world meeting Fortnite's present. I have literally no idea what to expect at this point, but let's take some guesses anyway. The signs usually snap into place after the fact.",1,8

html body div article section div p span  ,"to believe. Maybe the cube will somehow send the entire map back in time, reshuffle the locations and the eras they're attached to.",1,8
html body div article section div h3 span  ,What kind of map changes will Fortnite Season 6 see?,1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"Besides the possibility of a castle area, we have no idea what the map changes will look like. We",1,8
html body div article section div p em span  ,do,1,9
html body div article section div p span  ,have an inkling about where they'll take place though. FNBRLeaks sums it up succinctly,1,8
html body div article section div p a span  ,in this thread,1,9
html body div article section div p span  ,.,1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"The basic idea is that when the rocket launched last season, almost every major area it passed over has been affected since. The thruster landed in Anarchy Acres and it's gone now, replaced by Lazy Links. It popped out over Tilted Towers, which currently has a new building under construction. It flew over most of Moisty Mire, which is a desert now, and burst out by the hill near Greasy Grove, which is home to the chilly viking village. The only location that hasn't seen a change where the rocket appeared? Loot Lake.",1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"Loot Lake has been quite the contentious area since Fortnite BR first launched. As a wide open area that slows movement and basically requires building, it's not necessarily a fun location until the endgame when players have enough mats to bridge the waters. Personally, I don't hate the area, but its size and proximity to the center of the map make it an annoyance to bump into more often than not. While I don't think the water needs to go completely, changes to the area are long overdue. A bouncy surface is a welcome wrinkle, but it's not novel enough to stay around. Expect more changes to Loot Lake and other areas of the map.",1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"Plus, as much as I like the desert area, it makes the map look a touch lopsided. There",1,8
html body div article section div p em span  ,have,1,9
html body div article section div p span  ,"to be some people at Epic that agree and won't let such an aesthetic injustice stand. I'll be surprised if another chunk of the map isn't reworked in a similar way, new color palette, biome, and all.",1,8
html body div article section div h3 span  ,What new items will we see in Fortnite Season 6?,1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"A trend is emerging with the technology introduced each season and the items that spring from them. In Season 4 hop rocks were consolidated into bounce pads before disappearing in Season 5. And in Season 5, rifts might be going away for good, but rifts-to-go maintain their sky-diving teleportation powers in a cheap snow globe. It's likely that the cube will introduce some new form of technology that affects movement in some way, which will then be turned into its own item or items. No matter what we see, with Fortnite's arsenal filling out, Season 6 will almost certainly see the most unpredictable new tools.",1,8
html body div article section div h3 span  ,What kind of skins will we see in Fortnite Season 6?,1,8
html body div article section div figure figcaption div p span  ,"Like most season teasers, expect the party llama to appear as a battle pass skin in Season 6.",0,11
html body div article section div p span  ,"Truthfully, besides the party llama, we're not sure yet. If time-travel is explored further this season then we could see more cultures and time periods arrive as skins. More knights, a king, a queen, a jester, and other medieval archetypes are likely to show up if the castle is the real deal. Fortnite's skins are so varied anyway that it's safe to expect anything.",1,8
html body div article section div h3 span  ,How much will the Fortnite Season 6 battle pass cost?,1,8
html body div article section div p span  ,"If previous seasons are anything to go by, the Fortnite Season 6 battle pass will cost 950 V-Bucks, or approximately $10.",1,8
