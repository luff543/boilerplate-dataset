html body div div div div h2 span  ,Where and why did AMBER Alert first start?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"The AMBER Alert System began in 1996 when Dallas-Fort Worth broadcasters teamed with local police to develop an early warning system to help find abducted children. AMBER stands for America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response and was created as a legacy to 9-year-old Amber Hagerman, who was kidnapped while riding her bicycle in Arlington, Texas, and then brutally murdered. Other states and communities soon set up their own AMBER plans as the idea was adopted across the nation.",1,8
html body div div div div h2 span  ,How does it work?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"Once law enforcement has determined that a child has been abducted and the abduction meets AMBER Alert criteria, law enforcement notifies broadcasters and state transportation officials. AMBER Alerts interrupt regular programming and are broadcast on radio and television and DOT highway signs. AMBER Alerts can also be re-disseminated through lottery, digital billboards, Internet Ad exchanges, Internet Service Providers, Internet search engines, as well as wireless devices such as mobile phones.",1,8
html body div div div div h2 span  ,How effective has it been?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"As of December 23, 2015 there have been 800 children rescued and returned specifically because of AMBER Alert.",1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,AMBER Alerts also serve as deterrents to those who would prey upon our children. AMBER Alert cases have shown that some perpetrators release the abducted child after hearing the AMBER Alert.,1,8
html body div div div div h2 span  ,Who is the National Coordinator for AMBER Alert and what is the Coordinator's role?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, serves as the National AMBER Alert Coordinator. The role of the National Coordinator is to facilitate the development of the AMBER network, support the development of state AMBER plans and efforts, help eliminate geographic gaps in AMBER networks, provide regional AMBER network coordination and provide guidance on criteria for issuing an AMBER Alert.",1,8
html body div div div div h2 span  ,How does the AMBER Alert plan help children and families?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"The establishment of AMBER Alert plans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and the expansion of the program into Indian Country and our northern and southern borders mark an important milestone in our efforts to prevent child abductions. No matter where a child is abducted, communities and law enforcement work together to recover missing children quickly and safely. As of December 23, 2015, 800 children have been recovered because of the AMBER Alert system. AMBER Alert is making a difference in saving children's lives.",1,8
html body div div div div h2 span  ,What are the criteria for issuing AMBER Alerts?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"Each state AMBER Alert plan includes its own criteria for issuing AMBER Alerts. The PROTECT Act, passed in 2003, which established the role of AMBER Alert Coordinator within the Department of Justice, calls for the Department of Justice to issue minimum standards or guidelines for AMBER Alerts that states can adopt voluntarily. The Department's Guidance on Criteria for Issuing AMBER Alerts is as follows:",1,8
html body div div div div ul li span  ,There is reasonable belief by law enforcement that an abduction has occurred.,1,9
html body div div div div ul li span  ,The law enforcement agency believes that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death.,1,9
html body div div div div ul li span  ,There is enough descriptive information about the victim and the abduction for law enforcement to issue an AMBER Alert to assist in the recovery of the child.,1,9
html body div div div div ul li span  ,The abduction is of a child aged 17 years or younger.,1,9

html body div div div div h2 span  ,Can AMBER Alerts be issued across state and jurisdictional lines?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,"Absolutely. When an AMBER Alert is issued an abductor may take the child outside the jurisdiction of the issuing law enforcement agency, crossing state boundaries. When that occurs, the AMBER Coordinator contacts the State AMBER Coordinator where the abducted child is believed to be and requests the AMBER Alert be extended into their jurisdiction. This is referred to as a Multi-state AMBER Alert activation.",1,8
html body div div div div h2 span  ,Are AMBER Alerts issued for all missing children?,1,8
html body div div div div p span  ,AMBER Alerts are issued for abducted children that meet the AMBER Alert criteria.
