html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,Clearly Mr. Peters is the mack-daddy of manifesto writing and he is clearly an inspiration to me. I've crushed on him since I wrote my first Excellence paper back in the 80s. He's been a unknowing career counselor to me on my very wacky and strange journey from finance to service to IT to marketing. So now I'm going to take a tip from him on the personal side and put it all on paper for the world to see.Ã‚ If I can come up with something that is 1/10 as intense and as filled with truth I will consider myself successful.,1,14

html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,"I've really been thinking a lot about what I want to post about now that I've decided to start up again. We went through so much change last year, so many good and wonderful things happened but somehow only the negative stuff made it into the blog - so much so that I felt it became a bit toxic and I had to walk away. The shower has always been my thinking spot and in last night's shower I think I hit on the reason why the blog got so ick.",1,14
html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,"We moved last year into the most wonderful neighborhood you can possibly imagine. I mean, it's the one that they make real estate commercials about. It's not my ideal house, I've always dreamed of the classic colonial but when we found this one there was so much else that was right - that I quietly but willingly kissed my dreams of brick and columns and banistered staircases goodbye. I felt a vibe from this house from the beginning despite the fact that our realtor was sure I'd hate it. And there was a lot to hate - the whole dame interior was PINK. This blog is the exact shade of pink that my entire house was. But I got a vibe. This house knew me, and I knew it. I got a vibe.",1,14
html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,What we didn't know is that we were getting the perfect street as well. And so many new and wonderful friends. And roots. We'd moved so many times that we'd stopped thinking about roots. We'd lived in this same town for 3 years now and maybe we knew 5 more people than when we first got her. We didn't bother putting down roots because we expected to move again. But we stayed in town and started putting down roots.,1,14
html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,"And what I realize now that it's gentle work creating roots. You do it with great care. And on some level I think I was afraid to blog about the connections and friendships I was making. They were new and fragile and beautiful and they had to be protected. It was such new territory for me making real, actual people you see everyday type friends. I didn't want to mess it up. I was being protective of them. They are not computer geeks, they do not blog, the have not presented themselves to the internet for inspection.",1,14
html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,The ladies are also stay at home moms. And that scared me. My experiences with stay at home moms hadn't been that positive in the past. In general they didn't seem to want to let the working mom's be a part of their club. So I was a little shy on that front as well but really wanting everything to work out. Blogging about it didn't seem like the best way to bridge the gap.,1,14

She's the girl on the outside that face it, most of us were (are). She looking in and wanting to be a part, wanting to be liked, and not sure how to make them see that she's cool too if they'd only give her a chance.

html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,Seems the Fifths Disease that Stinkerbell so lovely brought home three-weeks ago is a little more hard to handle when the adults of the house get it.

html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,The first thing to catch up I think would be the fact that we no longer refer to SugarPop as SugarPop. My girl's real names are awesome if I do say so myself but they are very similar in rhythm and cadence and I have a hard time yelling the correct one at them. So to have like sounding nicknames on top of that just didn't work out.,1,14
html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,So SugarPop became Stinkerbell (or StinkerPuss if I want to make Puddin' all crazy). If you'll remember Puddin loves Peter Pan like most girls love Cinderella.

html body text div div div div div div div div div p span  ,Well I am back again. I disabled this blog for a while because I sort of felt like I didn't know what I wanted to say anymore.
