html body text table tbody tr td span  ,"3:55 p.m., Feb. 1, 2005--With a staff of seven and more than 7,200 students living on campus, Housing Assignment Services has a challenging job. All freshmen must live on campus unless they live with their parents or guardians, and all undergraduates who apply and meet application deadlines must be accommodated each year, according to director Linda Carey.",1,8
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“We have a small, close-knit staff, and we all work together to try to accommodate students’ housing needs,” she said.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Housing Assignment Services has changed and expanded over the years, reflecting the ways the University itself has evolved, Carey said. There are different housing programs and opportunities for freshmen and undergraduates, such as LIFE (Learning Integrated Freshman Experience) clusters and special interest housing units, which are initiated by students, she said.

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“With modern technology, students also have different expectations and needs in their housing, and we work with Facilities and Residence Life to integrate what students require and want in housing and their residence halls,” she said. Because they know what students want and need, the staff was asked for their input on the new residence halls that are being built now on the Laird Campus.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“We work closely with residence life, which occupies the second floor of our building, in helping students resolve any housing or roommate problems they may have,” Carey said.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“We also see that housing regulations are enforced, such as no pets, except for service dogs and small fish aquariums,” she said.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Computers have enhanced and streamlined Housing Assignment Services, according to Kirsten Brown who coordinates room assignments and has worked in housing for 15 years.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“We used to ask three questions of students and then go through all the applications one by one to match students with similar interests. Now we can ask 11 questions, ranging from neatness to night and day personalities, and the computer compiles the information and links the likes and needs of students to help pair compatible roommates. Since we handle such large numbers, this is invaluable,” Brown said. (For more student housing information and/or to arrange a campus tour, visit [",1,9
