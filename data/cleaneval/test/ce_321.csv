html body text p span  ,"The dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) eradication campaign has specific implications forefforts to control other emerging infectious diseases. Guinea worm, a painful disfiguringdisease, affects primarily adults, who often become ill in very large numbers (usually 30%or more of a village's population) during the planting or harvest season. The disease usedto be transmitted in parts of Asia and in Africa in open standing stagnant water. Theintermediate host of the parasite, the copepod, contains the larva of the worm in suchopen drinking water; these organisms are barely visible in a glass of drinking water heldup to the light. Thirteen years ago, the disease was still endemic in parts of the Indiansubcontinent, a small part of Pakistan and India, Yemen, and the band of countries acrossAfrica from east to west.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"Several interventions have been used to end transmission of Guinea worm disease: healtheducation (teaching people to filter their water through a finely woven cloth and not toenter water when they or their neighbors are infectious), safe drinking water from suchsources as underground borehole wells, and vector control (using Abate).",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The Guinea worm campaign, like other campaigns in the past, has illustrated theimportance of political mobilization, including the mobilization of national leaders. Forexample, General Amadou Toumani TourÃ© (a charismatic former head of state of the Republicof Mali), with the encouragement of President Carter in 1992, made the eradication ofGuinea worm disease in Mali and in the nine other French-speaking countries in West Africahis personal mission.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The campaign faces a problem common to many other efforts to control infectiousdiseases in the industrialized and the developing world: underreporting. For example, inGhana, as in Nigeria 10 years ago, and in many other countries, only three or fourthousand cases of Guinea worm disease were officially reported; but the actual numberswere much higher. In 1989 when Ghana conducted a nationwide village-by-village search,almost 180,000 cases were found. Sudan began its eradication program late because of civilwar. In 1996 and 1997, an apparent decline of cases in Sudan was due to less completereporting because of increased fighting in 1997.",1,5
html body text h3 b span  ,The Campaign's Implications for Other Diseases,1,6
html body text p span  ,"The Guinea worm campaign has demonstrated very graphically the possibility ofvillage-based monthly reporting in Africa. In Ghana and Nigeria at the beginning of thisprogram 10 years ago, such reporting did not exist. Now in those countries, more than6,000 disease-endemic villages have volunteers who report to the national capital monthly.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The Guinea worm campaign has also demonstrated very clearly the efficacy of healtheducation. In the beginning, many were skeptical because Guinea worm could not be combatedwith a vaccine, and eradication efforts had to rely on behavior change. However, behaviorhas changed. While we have been successful in helping to bring safe drinking water to manydisease-endemic villages, the fastest and most effective intervention has been healtheducation, which helped people understand where the parasite was coming from, how theywere being infected, and the importance of using cloth filters to protect themselves andtheir families.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The campaign has underscored the potential of local volunteers. Many years ago in theAmericas, village volunteers were used as part of malaria control efforts. Theonchocerciasis control program in Africa is also using village volunteers successfully.The Guinea worm campaign has been another illustration of how volunteers can be used todiagnose, report, and provide, in this instance, on-the-spot treatment to neighbors for aspecific infection. Those responsible for the campaign's success are often not members ofthe general health services.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"With the help of the World Bank, the Guinea worm campaign demonstrates the importanceof disease eradication to the national economy. The World Bank has estimated that theeconomic rate of return on the investment in Guinea worm eradication will be on the orderof 29% per year once the disease is eradicated. That figure is based on a veryconservative estimate of the average amount of time infected workers are unable to performagricultural tasks.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The campaign has also created a group of trained health-care workers of a differentgeneration from those involved in the smallpox eradication program. These workers havegone from beginning to end, from hearing the doubters and seeing the difficulty ofinitiating the campaign to tasting victory in their own countries. These workers cancontribute to subsequent campaigns. Moreover, the concept of eradication, which was indisrepute only 5, 10 years ago, has been revived. Soon we will confirm that a nonviraldisease for which vaccine is not available can be eradicated.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Like the smallpox eradication campaign, the Guinea worm campaign has illustrated veryvividly in many different ways and at many different levels (from international to villagelevel) the power of data. In the Guinea worm campaign, we have used surveillance data topromote health policy. One key lesson from the smallpox campaign we are deliberatelyapplying in the Guinea worm campaign is to distill what needs to be done in terms ofinterventions to a handful, or almost a handful, of indexes (seven on an internationallevel) to know what is most important and (as rapidly as possible) how well we are doing.That unleashes inordinate amounts of energy.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Finally, the Guinea worm eradication campaign will have illustrated again the power ofdemonstration. Eradication can happen because it has happened.",1,5
