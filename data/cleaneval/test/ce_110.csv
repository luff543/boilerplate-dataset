She whinnies her pleasure at Davis�sfamiliar scent, flinching for a few seconds, unsure of my presence.Davis reaches out a reassuring hand, running it lightly up her side, overher mottled gray spots, up the quivering neck. Combing his fingers throughthe tangled shag on her neck, he whispers to me, in the darkness, �Thesehere are witches� tails, these tangles. They�re from when the witches ride�em at night. Only the real wild ones have �em. That�s how you tell.�",1,5
html body text font span  ,"Davis�s wild mare islikely the only true mustang (Mustang - from the Spanish, monstrenco -�roving, rough, wild�) in captivity. True to her spirit, she escapes regularly,but she always comes back to him. �The wild instinct is in her. I neverdid break her,� he laughs.",1,5
html body text font span  ,"The species the mare represents is typicallysmall in stature, with a stocky build, large head and flowing mane andtail almost reaching the ground. Her kind are plain rugged, hardlythe Hollywood movie version of the Western horse. Their rough-cast stoutnessis the very quality that has allowed them to survive the fierce strenuousnessof the Old West and the less picturesque cruelties of modern times.",1,5
html body text font span  ,Certain wildlife officialsand sport hunters have claimed the wild horses of Western Canada are merelyferal - just runaway packing horses from old logging and miningcamps.,1,5
html body text font span  ,"But Davis�s lean, scruffyponies of the foothills are indeed the true item. His mustangs are thetough, rough mares and stallions of legendary Indian days, not at all likethe bovine scrags commonly called �mustangs� by some.",1,5
html body text font span  ,"Unfortunately, Alberta�spopulation of feral runaway horses hogs the public attention that ought to go to the real mustangs. Most notably, the runaways roamingthe fenced-in grasslands of CFB Suffield, northwest of Calgary, havebeen made famous by highly publicized protests over a 1988 roundup.Protestors mistakenly called the heavy Suffield horses mustangs. In fact, the feral horses of Suffield, with their mixed Shire, Suffolk andClydesdale bloodline, are no more mustangs than Old Bessie. Theirclaim on Western heritage is dubious.",1,5
html body text font span  ,"If anyone knows themustangs, Davis does. He has been their advocate for decades, havingbeen instrumental in persuading the Alberta government in 1974 to stopissuing seasonal licences to hunt them. Still, he says, �It�s somethingterrible what they�ve done to them horses. There�s not too many left. They�vebeen hunted and chased, and killed. They�re scattered and gone.� Nobodyseems to care about the mustangs, says Davis, including even the HumaneSociety, who, he says, should do something about the condition in whichhorses often arrive at auction houses. They�re too often delivered to auctionbleeding, crippled, and blinded by their frantic struggling againstthe leg snares hunters use to trap them, says Davis.",1,5

html body text p font span  ,"Modern archaeology looks to fossil remainsfrom sediments in Wyoming suggesting that Equus Caballus, the horse, wasnative to North America 60 million years ago. The horse alternatelyappears and disappears from the fossil record at about one million yearintervals. All trace of the horse is lost by about 25,000 years ago.The species was unknown to the American continent when Columbus sailedfrom Spain on his voyage of discovery.",1,6
html body text p font span  ,"But historians say thatColumbus , and even the subsequent Spanish explorers, Coronado and DeSoto, couldn�t themselves have reintroduced the lost species to North America.They argue that, although the earliest Spanish explorers did indeed bringhorses with them to the New World, they brought only limited numbersof the animals, and very few of those were mares. Coronado, for example, wrote in his diary that he had brought �five hundred and fifty-eighthorses, two of them mares.� Two mares could hardly have stocked the whole continent, say historians.",1,6
html body text p font span  ,"More likely sources for theNorth American population of ponies, say historians, were stock-raisingranches established by the Spanish in the Santa Fe area between the 1550sand the 1700s. The ranches furnished ideal conditions for the spread ofhorses to the rest of the continent : friendly contact with the Indiansthrough trade, an ample supply of horses, and plenty of opportunities forthe Indians to study possible uses for the new creature.",1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Logically, the movement ofhorses into the North Americas would have followed established inter-tribal trade routes. From Spanish records we know that, beginning around1600, southwest tribes such as the Utes, Comanches, Apaches and Kiowasbegan raiding the Spanish ranches and stealing large numbers of horses.From those tribes, the horses slowly spread across the continent.La Verendrye reported that tribes living northeast of the Black Hillsin Montana had no horses when he visited them in 1738. Yet just 16 yearslater in 1754 Anthony Henday, the Hudson�s Bay Company explorer, met Assiniboinesin the same area who had horses, though they used them only for packing,not for riding. By 1766 Henday reported numerous Assiniboines now skillfullyriding the horses.",1,6

html body text p font span  ,"Eventually horse- stealingbecame the foremost means to acquire more horses, and full blown�horse culture� was in full swing among the Indian tribes by the end ofthe century. The �Indian pony� - small, squat and tough - became the mainstay of Indian life, indispensable in transport, warfare,leisure, hunting, religion and trade. So it waspractically inevitable that Indians began to measure wealth by the numberof horses a man owned. The number of horses owned by individual Indiansgrew dramatically.",1,6

That year saw the last major horse-raiding party of theOld West. Canadian Piegans rode down out of the Calgary area to the PryorCreek area of northern Montana. They made off with 60 horses stolen fromthe Crows camped there. To this day a mysterious herd of wild horses isknown to exist in the Pryor Mountain area.

Objections have been raised on the grounds of cruelty,but professional wild horse hunters shrug their critics off. �Round �emup, and shoot a tranquilizer into them, and those horses don�t give a damnwhether they end up as dog food or rodeo buckers,� one big game hunterremarked to a Calgary reporter.",1,6
html body text p font span  ,"In the 1950s, the slaughterreached high gear when hunters discovered that the horses could be panickedby dive-bombing airplanes. Terrified horses were buzzed from above, andraced cross-country until, at the point of exhaustion, they couldbe driven into corals. Frantic, the horses were loaded into waitingtrucks for transport to auction or slaughterhouses. Many would arrive atthe slaughterhouse already dead, trampled to death in transit. Itwas not an uncommon sight to see the trucks dripping blood on the highways.",1,6

html body text p font span  ,"Mustangs have this peculiar will to die - so sensitive and vulnerableare they to pursuit and capture. Explorer David Thompson documentedthis amazing vulnerability of mustangs as early as 1809. He wrotein his diary while crossing the West that wild horses froze as if paralyzed when his men merely �shouted a halloa� and dashed at them. Hewas only the first of many horse runners to report the phenomenon.Modern hunters still observe that stallions, in particular, commonlyseem unable to survive the ordeal of being captured and will to die within hours or days of being deprived of their freedom. Wholebands have collapsed in paroxysms of fear when subjected to the experienceof being rounded up and corralled.",1,6

The only part you might have doubtabout is the loading of the frightened animals onto trucks.� Nevertheless, the dive-bombing bloodbaths were brought to an endin 1959. Forest conservation officials felt pressured by publiccries for more compassionate treatment of the mustangs, and, magnanimously,decreed that roundup by cattle horse, not by dive-bombers, was theonly humane way to go.",1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Thenumbers of mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century. A 1895 police census showed 42,257 wild horses on the range in SouthernAlberta. In 1958 a roundup expert said huge tracts of Alberta land carriedvast wild horse herds. �The whole place is a wild horse kingdom,� saidChester Utter in a report in The Albertan newspaper in August, 1958. Utterboasted that he alone had rounded up more than 40,000 horses. One yearlater, in 1959, the Calgary Herald carried a front-page story saying thehorses were �facing extinction.� The next year, 1960, the Alberta Cattlemen�sAssociation said there were some 3,000 still roaming at will. By 1977,The Herald thought that about 1,000 head of wild horses roamed the foothills.In 1991 Alberta Fish and Wildlife counted 300 mustangs roaming free inKananaskis Country.",1,6

Ryden, who worked as features producer for ABCNews from 1966 to 1968, argued persuasively in her book America�sLast Wild Horses that the very fact that these horses have prevailedfor so long against so many odds - hunters, bitter weather, rough terrain, extensive grazing competition and high infant mortality - suggests that they must come from exceptionally hardy stock, namely,the Spanish stock of the original Indian ponies.
