In this article, I shall discuss specific instances to support this thesis, but atthis point one other general thought needs to be considered. That is the idea that grandstrategy developed differently in what we now call the Western nations (particularly inthe United States) than it did in the Soviet Union. Although both are equally rooted inclassical strategic theory and both are valid expressions of grand strategy, thestrategies of today's East-West rivals, like races of men evolved from a single ancestor,gradually acquired distinctive features.
