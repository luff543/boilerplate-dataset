This guy's a real Einstein. Grocery store managers are laughing at him, with his uneducated claims of 300% profit. Grocers only make 1% to 3% profit. We don't ask grocers to drop the price on an 89 cent can of peas. We use coupons, or buy it at a cheaperstore. When a store sells you a steak, they don't lie about your credit score; force you to buy VIN# etching; or a steak warranty you didn't want. Mr. Autos thinks weknow nothing?

It gives theconsumer info and definitely helps them form getting hurt. I just want to let the people know that not all of us are bad. I am in this business to make a living andput food on the table. I work very hard and I EXPECT to make money from it. Of course it has to be legit. I feel that the car business does have a bad rap, but I amworking on it on my end. Just a message to the folks reading: It isn't necessarily a bad thing for a dealer to make money. Be fair and they will be fair towards you(most of us). Don't expect something for nothing though. There has to be some profit. Just do some homework and you'll be fine. Buying a warranty isn't a bad thingeither. It's just like insurance. Over paying for a warranty is bad though.
