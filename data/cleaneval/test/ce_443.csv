html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,Introduction,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here, and I am honored to be back at the FTC as its Chairman.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"As many of you may know, this is my third tour at the FTC. I first served as Assistant to the Director of the Office of Policy Planning and Evaluation in the mid 1970s. I returned in 1981 to serve as the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and then became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983. I am fully committed to the institution and its mission of protecting consumers through actively enforcing our antitrust and consumer protection laws. I return as Chairman with great anticipation of the challenges and excitement that lie ahead.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"There has been considerable speculation about possible changes at the Commission. Some predicted that there would be substantial continuity from the previous administration, with changes mainly at the margins. Others agreed that there would be continuity but hedged their bets - they were uncertain how wide the margins might be. Others predicted - perhaps wishfully - that changes would be more dramatic. For example, they anticipated substantially reduced merger enforcement. I expect the last group will be disappointed. A vigorous enforcement program is necessary to fulfill the agency's mission to protect consumers. The first group has it right. Continuity will be the norm, with changes at the margins.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"We have assembled a first-rate staff. In the operating Bureaus, we have: Howard Beales, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection; Bill Kovacic, General Counsel; David Scheffman, Director of the Bureau of Economics; and Joe Simons, Director of the Bureau of Competition. All have extensive experience in their fields; each has substantial prior experience at the FTC; and each has extensive post-FTC experience related to the agency's mission. Joining this group are Anna Davis, Director of Congressional Relations, who also previously worked at the FTC, Rosemarie Straight, who remains as Executive Director, and two newcomers: Ted Cruz, who is our new Director of Policy Planning, and Cathy MacFarlane, who will head our Office of Public Affairs. I appointed these individuals because of their superb qualifications and, like me, they are committed to the FTC and its mission.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Today, I will sketch a vision of the landscape ahead. Along the way, I will retrace the origins of some of the policies that I expect to follow. You will see that continuity should not come as a surprise. There is much ground to cover, and I will touch on each topic only briefly. You will hear more about each of these subjects in the coming months.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Before continuing, I should repeat the standard disclaimer that my remarks today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Commission or of any other Commissioner.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,I. Why Should We Expect Continuity?,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Antitrust has become an area of bipartisan cooperation. Although there are disagreements about specific cases, there is widespread agreement that the purpose of antitrust is to protect consumers, that economic analysis should guide case selection, and that horizontal cases, both mergers and agreements among competitors, are the mainstays of antitrust. Moreover, today there is bipartisan recognition that antitrust law is a way of helping to organize our economy. A freely functioning market, subject to the rules of antitrust, provides maximum benefits to consumers.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Bob Pitofsky's tenure as FTC Chairman was in that vein of bipartisanship. In fact, he and his appointees praised the leadership of his predecessor, Janet Steiger, who was appointed by the first President Bush. Bob was clearly one of the most effective Chairmen in the history of the Commission.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(1),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Of course, Bob brought his intellect, scholarship, and management skills to the job. But a key reason for Bob's success as Chairman was that his agenda and enforcement policies reflected the bipartisan consensus. Those policies were not significantly different from those of his predecessor in the previous administration. There were changes at the margins, and, as would any new chairman, Bob faced some new challenges. That is my message today - there will be some changes at the margins, but mainly there will be continuity. There will not be a sea change in enforcement.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Bob Pitofsky set a high standard, and he should be applauded for his efforts on behalf of consumers. He and I may differ on certain points, but I, too, intend to characterize my tenure by what I do, rather than what I do not do. Let me turn to some specific areas of antitrust.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,II. Merger Enforcement,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,This year is the 25,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p sup span  ,th,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,anniversary of the passage of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(2),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The passage of HSR and the resulting evolution of merger enforcement policy has undoubtedly been the most important statutory development in antitrust for several decades. Like antitrust enforcement generally, merger enforcement is about protecting consumers from unwarranted exercise of market power. As the Chairman of the FTC, I take that mandate very seriously. I do not see significant change in basic merger enforcement from the Pitofsky Commission. We will apply the Merger Guidelines",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(3),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"to the available facts, as did the Pitofsky Commission. Problematic mergers will face the same hurdles they did during the 1990s.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,A. Evolution of Merger Policy in the 1970s and Early 1980s,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Let me add some historical perspective on why continuity is appropriate. By the time of the,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,General Dynamics,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"decision in 1974,",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(4),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,it was clear that merger policy would have to change to reflect new realities. Cases like,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,Von's,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,were relics of the past.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(5),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Economic research debunked the fears of market concentration at even low levels.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(6),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Rigid reliance on concentration statistics and structural presumptions would no longer suffice; we would have to look at the competitive dynamics of the market. There was growing awareness that we live in a global economy - market boundaries don't necessarily end at the U.S. border. And there was a growing realization that efficiencies are important.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Those changes were reflected in 1982 Merger Guidelines,",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(7),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,promulgated during Bill Baxter's regime at the Antitrust Division. The new Guidelines were a milestone in antitrust. They incorporated an economically sound analytical structure that was workable in practice and provided clear guideposts for businesses and antitrust practitioners.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The 1982 Guidelines laid the foundation for today's merger enforcement. Although improved over the years, the core analytical structure remains the same. The Guidelines have stood the test of time and have become even more influential. The courts increasingly follow them, and they have greatly influenced merger enforcement across the world. Bill Baxter is, unfortunately, no longer with us, but his legacy lives on. His Guidelines were applied by Bob Pitofsky's Commission, and I expect to do the same.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"In fact, I was one of the early implementers of the 1982 Guidelines' analytical structure. We were an active, even proactive Commission back then. I became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983, and during my 2� years in that position, we dealt with matters such as:",1,11

html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(16),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,laid out most of the basics of how the FTC has analyzed much larger oil mergers over the past decade. The consumer products merger investigation was one of the first to use statistical methodologies to analyze substitutability of branded products. That analysis by our Bureau of Economics stimulated further research and paved the way for today's major cottage industry of economists doing econometric analyses of consumer demand for branded products.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,Warner-Polygram,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"presented very complex issues in analyzing coordinated interaction in a dynamic industry that thrives by constantly developing new, differentiated products. Both",1,11

html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,and the two,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,carbon black,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,mergers were successfully challenged in court. The,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,Warner-Polygram,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,decision has been very influential in the Commission's ability to obtain preliminary injunctions under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Finally, the Commission's lengthy, very extensive investigation of the GM-Toyota joint venture was important, both for the U.S. automobile industry and American consumers, and in guiding later thinking about joint ventures. Our examination of the potential efficiencies of the joint venture was controversial at the time. Today, however, there are few who would argue with allowing the venture to proceed.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,B. The Importance of Facts,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Those of you who were involved with mergers in those early days following the 1982 Guidelines know that we all had a lot to learn. This was particularly true of the Guidelines' new approach to market definition. We also quickly learned that merger analysis under this new regime was incredibly,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong em span  ,fact intensive,1,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of this country, once discussed facts in a manner directly relevant for us today. In 1770, Adams defended the British officer and soldiers accused of murder in the Boston Massacre. He said:",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,Facts are stubborn things,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(17),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Stubborn facts are what changed antitrust law and enforcement after the 1970s. For example, a 1983 Washington Post editorial on the GM-Toyota joint venture stated:",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote p span  ,[T]he rules of antitrust law as they had developed [in the 1960s and 1970s] were undermined by observation of how the world works.,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote p a sup span  ,(18),0,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,We learned long ago that,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,facts are stubborn things,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"in merger enforcement. No economic theory or story-based advocacy about a merger will give you a reliable answer unless the facts firmly support it. This is absolutely as it should be. This is why no change in Administration or change in faces in the agencies will significantly change merger enforcement. Just as we have the burden of proving that a merger likely will be anticompetitive, you will need to demonstrate with sound, stubborn fact-based analyses the claims that you make.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,C. Maintaining the Basic Approach,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"By saying that there will be continuity, I do not mean to suggest that I agreed with every specific enforcement action of the Pitofsky Commission; I did not. Overwhelmingly, however, when the parties pushed the Commission into court, the Commission won. So, how stubborn do your facts have to be? I agree with the approach of the Pitofsky Commission. If a merger appears problematic, the facts on your side have to be stubborn enough to convince a federal judge that we cannot obtain a preliminary injunction.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"I know that some in the press and the Bar think that the Bush administration will relax antitrust enforcement. I urge them, and you, to watch what we do. I can tell you unequivocally that if you come in with transactions that would not fly in the past, you are likely to ""crash""unless you have compelling, stubborn facts on your side. To some of you, let me say it more bluntly. A few members of the merger bar have been telling the press that we are going to have more relaxed standards. Those folks will be doing their actual or potential clients a big disservice if those clients act on that presumption. If you are an experienced merger attorney, you know a problematic merger when you see it.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,D. Attention to Competitive Effects Theories,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Staying the course does not mean that we will stop thinking about the theories we apply. Theories of anticompetitive effects have evolved over time, and will continue to do so. For example, although we have always had what could be called ""unilateral effects"" theories, they have evolved, and they have been more widely applied since the 1992 revision of the Guidelines.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(19),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Some question whether the agency has gone too far in applying unilateral effects theories. One argument is that we may be in danger of returning to antitrust that focused on the elimination of competition between the parties to the merger, rather than competition at the market level. I would not go that far. It is too early to tell whether theory has outstripped reality. I do agree that we should be sure that we have the facts to apply a unilateral effects theory.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The analysis of unilateral effects often relies substantially on econometric analysis of scanner data. We need to understand better the potential limitations of the data. Although the analysis is highly complex, the theories underlying merger simulation models are based on simple and restrictive assumptions. These can be useful tools, but we are looking at them more closely to understand better their strengths and limitations.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Coordinated interaction theories have also evolved. In recent years there has been more focus on theories of coordinated interaction involving alleged price discrimination. This is an area in which facts are particularly important. We all understand that price,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,differences,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,", themselves, are not evidence of price discrimination. Price discrimination requires, among other things, ""systematic"" pricing policies that result in evidence of",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,actual,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,transaction prices that is consistent with a theory of price discrimination.,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,E. Areas Where Enforcement Policy is Still Evolving,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Although the basics of merger enforcement are firmly in place, there are important substantive areas that are still evolving: ""high tech""mergers involving significant innovation issues; efficiencies; and remedies.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td dl dd em strong span  ,High Tech Mergers,1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Merger analysis in ""high tech"" industries is not fundamentally different than in other industries. The basic Guidelines analysis can be applied. We should proceed, however, cognizant of our lesser experience in high tech industries. Moreover, the high tech arena, by its nature, is constantly changing. New high tech industries, often with new technical issues, continue to be born and to change.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"One aspect of high tech may warrant especially close scrutiny. The fierce competition for success in these industries often results in the ""winner"" enjoying a (perhaps short-lived) monopoly. We should be especially reluctant to allow those firms to merge with actual (or potential) competitors. This was part of the basis for my criticism of the Clinton Antitrust Division's failure to challenge the Microsoft-Web TV merger.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(20),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Given the relative newness of applying the Guidelines to high tech industries, we should assess the effects of our enforcement actions, as well as monitor the outcomes when we decide not to intervene. We will look for opportunities to use the Bureau of Economics in these retrospective examinations to help inform future decisions.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td dl dd em strong span  ,Efficiencies,1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The agencies have come far in recognizing the significance of merger efficiencies. In 1980, I wrote an article arguing that the agencies should recognize the relevance of merger efficiency claims.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(21),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Today, there is no question that they are relevant, as the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines reflected. The 1997 revision of the Efficiencies section of the Guidelines further improved the analytical treatment of efficiencies. And a growing number of courts now recognize the relevance of efficiency claims.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Despite this progress, the treatment of efficiencies in merger enforcement has room for further improvement. I have argued that the agencies should recognize additional classes of efficiencies, and that their argument in court is still much too hostile.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(22),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The analysis will continue to evolve based on facts and study. These are changes at the margin, however. From my experience in the 1980s and as a consultant, few cases will turn solely on the efficiency issue. The bedrock principle of merger enforcement remains the same - protect consumers. In efficiencies, as in any other analysis, the facts are crucial. Efficiency claims that are not firmly based in stubborn facts will be given no weight.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td dl dd em strong span  ,Remedies,1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Commission's recent posture on merger remedies is controversial within the bar. Merger remedies, like other aspects of antitrust, have evolved during the last 20 years. During much of the 1980s, the agency resolved cases relatively less frequently with settlements. When we did settle, however, we insisted on strong structural relief. Our lengthy review and negotiations for remedies in the Texaco-Getty matter in 1984 led some lawyers for Texaco to suggest that we were a distraction from their goals. That view of our role is misinformed. An effective remedy is a fundamental part of merger enforcement. Now, as then, we must protect consumers, not help you get your deal through at consumers' expense.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"One of the techniques the Commission has recently used is an up-front buyer of divested assets. Much of the criticism in the Bar has been that the process of identifying and vetting an up-front buyer slows down the settlement process. A countervailing consideration is that an up-front buyer can provide added assurance that a settlement will work as planned. It may be particularly useful when proposed divestiture involves an asset package that constitutes less than an ongoing business, whose viability is somewhat uncertain, or assets that may deteriorate over time. There is thus an appropriate use for up-front buyers on occasion.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"An up-front buyer is not an end in itself, of course. Our principal goal is to protect consumers. We will require a divestiture that will likely create a viable",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong em span  ,business entity,1,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"(rather than a creation of lawyers) to resolve the competitive problems posed by the merger. We may be confident before identifying one specific buyer that acceptable candidates exist. As with so much else of modern merger analysis, the issue is highly fact specific.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,F. The Merger Review Process,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"As I noted earlier, this year marks the 25",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p sup span  ,th,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Anniversary of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. A lot has changed. When I became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983, the merger review process under HSR was still evolving; we were still on the learning curve. Today, we have a well-functioning program in place - not perfect, as all of you will agree, but it does a remarkable job. We have a smaller professional staff than we did in the early 1980s, as well as fewer support staff, but we review many times more merger filings. We have highly skilled and dedicated lawyers and economists, and an excellent senior management team. The Bureau of Competition and Bureau of Economics work closely together. Merger review is firmly grounded in facts and sound economic analysis.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"But as I said, not all is perfect. Thousands of mergers are filed each year, and some questionable transactions may slip through the screening process. The recent amendments to the HSR Act, which increased the filing threshold, may have made it more likely that we will miss a few problematic transactions. I have directed BC Director Joe Simons to increase our efforts in reviewing the business press and other sources to identify potentially problematic mergers. If you have clients that are concerned with a transaction, let us know -",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,whether or not it has been consummated,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,". We are quite prepared to go after consummated mergers or mergers that are too small to require an HSR filing. In addition, we will continue to vigorously pursue parties who do not comply with the procedural requirements of the HSR regulations, our first line of defense against anticompetitive mergers. Some of you may recall that, during my tenure as Bureau Director, we brought the first 7(a) case.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p a sup span  ,(23),0,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Let me turn now to 2,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p sup span  ,nd,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,Requests. The burdens of the 2,1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p sup span  ,nd,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Request process continue to be a concern. Although the agencies have made substantial efforts to reduce the burden, there is room for further improvement. The number of boxes of documents submitted for a typical 2",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p sup span  ,nd,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Request has sky-rocketed. Where once we had hundreds of boxes, in some matters we now have",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p em span  ,thousands,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"of boxes. Of course, some mergers are very complex and tend to involve volumes of documents. Moreover, I have worked on enough mergers to know that you are not always trying to make the agency's job easy. In any event, given the burdens involved for both the merging parties and agency staff, we need to find ways to do our jobs more efficiently. We need to ensure that what you submit is as helpful as possible to our doing our job of protecting consumers. We will have more to say about this in the coming months.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"We are also trying to make merger investigations more efficient in other ways. As we all know, the statutory deadlines are almost never binding for a problematic merger. Because the deadlines are too short to analyze a complex merger fully, we usually arrange an accommodation for more time. Nonetheless, merger investigations, on average, probably take longer than necessary. We will try to expedite the process further.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Improved communication is part of the answer. Both sides have to join issue on the critical aspects of a merger. If a merger appears problematic, the burden is on the parties to convince us that there are no problems or that any problems can be fully remedied with a suitable divestiture. Without jeopardizing our position in potential litigation, we can probably communicate more clearly to the parties the bases of our concerns. Joe Simons and I are working to develop and implement procedures to improve the merger review process without compromising the ability to do our job.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"In that vein, we will be conducting ""best practices"" sessions with the Antitrust Division, beginning with 2d Request and remedies issues, to strengthen both of our agencies. In addition, the Bureau of Competition is planning a series of ""brown bag"" lunches in Washington, D.C., and some of our regional offices to discuss your concerns about remedies. We hope that these steps will offer additional bases for improving the merger review process.",1,11
html body text div center table tbody tr td p strong span  ,III. International Antitrust,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Let me turn to a new topic: competition policy in a global economy. Increasingly, U.S. companies and the U.S. antitrust agencies interact with our competition law counterparts. These interactions raise a multitude of procedural and substantive issues.

We are continuing those efforts. The competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry is very important to American consumers. We have a number of active, ongoing investigations, and we are also conducting a study of Hatch-Waxman related issues. As you probably know, a number of legislative proposals have been made to modify Hatch-Waxman to curb the alleged abuses.

These proceedings help us develop a better understanding of new economic and business developments, and their consumer-related implications, in a non-adversarial process, and are useful to the Commission, the Congress, and others, by informing policy and possibly future enforcement decisions.
