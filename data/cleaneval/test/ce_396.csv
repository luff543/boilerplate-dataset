html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Air,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Geoff Ryman’s wonderful tale about how we humans adjust to information technology is one of those books I thought would probably be too good to get the recognition it deserves. Really clever and subtle books often leave many readers going ""doh?"" and the more cynical ones saying, ""this isn’t commercial enough."" Plus being about the inhabitants of a small village in Central Asia is not likely to endear the book to a mass market. So I’m delighted to see Ryman’s book on the Philip K. Dick Award short list.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Banner of Souls,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Liz Williams keeps being on the brink of writing an utterly brilliant novel. This one came very close. It certainly boasts the most lyrical and atmospheric prose we have seen from her to date. Here’s hoping that she keeps on getting better. Williams is a regular feature on the Philip K. Dick Award short list, and this book is no exception.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,City of Pearl,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,– Karen Traviss’s debut novel was quite outstanding. It is a fairly fast paced and very political piece of SF that is both in the thick of the genre and fresh and interesting at the same time. Another Philip K. Dick Award nominee.,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Cloud Atlas,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– I don’t think than an SF book has ever been the hot favorite to win the Booker Prize before, and it may be several millennia before one is again. If it happens again in our lifetime, David Mitchell will be the man to achieve that honor. He’s the darling of the mainstream literature set, but at the same time you tell from reading",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Iron Sunrise,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Charlie Stross is about as hot as it gets in the SF world right now. His cutting-edge cyber-driven space operas are quite possibly incomprehensible to anyone without a background in SF and computers, but if you know what Stross is talking about then you quickly become in awe of his command of the jargon. All of the crazy, far-future technology he makes up sounds utterly plausible.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Newton’s Wake,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Ken MacLeod does comedy. Really he does. And what is more he manages to do comedy about politics. The scene where his heroine steps through a wormhole, falls onto a beach, and looks up to find a statue of Karl Marx towering over her will stay with me for a very long time. This being MacLeod, there is a lot of serious speculation about economics and politics in",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,River of Gods,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Ian MacDonald has never been afraid to do something different with his novels. But taking on the task of writing the quintessential Indian SF novel is probably the bravest thing he has done yet. AIs and nanotech explode across a landscape imbued with Hinduism, regional rivalries, caste politics and some interesting speculations about gender, or rather lack of it. Besides, how can I not love an SF novel that features a cricket match?",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Stamping Butterflies,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– North Africa still runs strongly through Jon Courtenay Grimwood’s fiction, but his latest novel is worlds away from El Iskandria. Although parts of the book are firmly rooted in Morocco, other sections drift dreamily through a massive, artificial world light years away and centuries into the future. The strands are connected through the political decisions of a present-day US present. Truly, the flapping of a butterfly’s wings can cause a storm on the far side of the galaxy.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,The Fourth Circle,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– If there is one book in this list that is going to get panned as “un-commercial” by most reviewers, this is it. Zoran Živkovi? pulls no punches in this delightfully strange and experimental story. And somehow it still manages to sound wonderful even after having been translated into English from Serbian.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,White Devils,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Move over Michael Crichton and Margaret Atwood, this is how a real science fiction writer does a biotech disaster thriller. Sure the book has a bunch of cartoon thriller villains, sure lots of people die in inventively nasty ways. That’s what thrillers are all about. But along the way Paul McAuley manages a much more sophisticated and adult approach to both the science and the politics than Crichton or Atwood seem capable of managing.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Iron Council,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– I still have my reservations about the central third of China Miéville’s latest Bas-Lag story, but there is no doubting the continued fabulous inventiveness of his writing and world creation. It was also a delight to see Miéville introduce an actual political revolution to New Crobuzon and not have it turn out happily ever after.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,– mainstream reviewers have been talking endlessly about the cleverness of the structure of David Mitchell’s,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,Cloud Atlas,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,". They should also take a look at Peter Straub’s wonderful new novel that mixes up writers and characters until the reader is hard-pressed to tell the difference. A lot of horror fiction is so bad and formulaic that even us SF folks look down on it with disdain, but Peter Straub is an author who can hold his own in any company.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– I don’t think that Susanna Clarke’s debut novel conquered the world in quite the way that Bloomsbury expected it to, but it certainly made a very big splash. It was also highly entertaining for most of its 800 or so pages, and this from someone who loathes Jane Austen. I guess it must have been the footnotes. Or the portrayal of Faerie. Or the Raven King. Or the brilliantly obnoxious Yorkshireness of Gilbert Norrell. England hasn’t read so well in a long time.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Mortal Love,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,– In the interview I did with Elizabeth Hand for,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,Strange Horizons,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"she talks about the edginess that a writer obtains by setting fantasy novels in the present day. Anyone can make magic believable in a pseudo-medieval, cookie-cutter fantasy world. It isn’t hard to make it believable in the 18",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p sup span  ,th,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Century. But to make people believe that magic happens in present day Camden Town, without the aid of any chemical supplements at all, is not only very difficult but profoundly disturbing as well. Elizabeth Hand can really make us believe that the world we know can be turned upside down in an instant, and that our lives will never be the same again.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Olympic Games,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– OK, so it was kind of cheesy for Leslie What to release a novel about Greek Gods in New York in a year in which the Olympics returned to Athens. But hey, everything else about the book was wonderfully inventive, not to mention very funny. Zeus and Hera are the archetypes of the sex war, and What used them to their full potential, while managing to have some very real human characters as well. A very promising debut.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,Perfect Circle,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Ah, class. With this book Sean Stewart has produced a perfect little ghost story. Several of the books in this list were published by small presses, but this is the only one of them where I was absolutely amazed that no major publisher had picked it up. The mainstream press should be raving about this book.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,The Wizard Knight,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,", because it appears to be less obscure and puzzle-filled than the New-Long-Short Sun series, but at the same time is more opaque. Just what is Wolfe getting at? Why the Norse gods, when Wolfe makes it clear that a single creator God exists above them and an archangel makes an appearance in the book? Well, because Wolfe is talking about layers of power and responsibility. Wolfe is making a case for the world being more than the stark Protestant division of Us and God, of Saved and Not-Saved. We all have free will, and we need to learn to use it responsibly.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,The Year of Our War,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Wow, three debut novels in the fantasy top ten. The world is indeed turned upside down. And perhaps nowhere more so than in Steph Swainston’s wonderfully imagined",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,this collection of more or less conventional and largely unconnected stories by Jeff Vandermeer will seem quite ordinary. But it isn’t. There are many very good stories indeed in this collection. Highly recommended.,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a i span  ,So Long Been Dreaming,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"– Another patchy anthology, mainly because too many of the authors let their anger or desire to make political points run away with their stories.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"shows the head of a bull, a typical piece of Minoan iconography. Its horns are twisted in a spiral reminiscent of the helical structure of DNA, and perhaps of two lives intertwined down the millennia. The bull, of course, is also a prime symbol of male power and aggression.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,But let us not forget that,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,Gene,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"is first and foremost a thriller. Therefore we cannot start with any of these biological speculations, and certainly not with the machinations of Greek gods. We have to start with guns and car chases. Let us therefore repair to present day New York where NYPD detective James North has been called out to a hostage situation at Metropolitan Museum of Art. Some loony who seems to think he is an ancient Greek warrior has been terrorizing visitors with an old Bronze Age sword, and he seems to be remarkably adept at using it.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"So the first fifty pages are spent in furious action and a chase around New York. The perp gets away, and much of the rest of the book is filled with Detective North’s efforts to track him down. Except that during their struggles the perp manages to inject North with a strange serum that turns out to be full of odd herbs and drugs. And from then on the Detective starts to suffer some very strange nightmares.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Pavlou carefully cuts the present day action with flashbacks through the centuries, charting the conflict between Athanatos and Cyclades backwards down the centuries. We visit the court of the alchemist emperor Rudolph in Prague, the lush palaces of Byzantium, the decadent court of Nero, and eventually the plains of Ilium themselves. There is much name-dropping of historical characters that might embarrass an experienced SF writer whose audience knows all these things already, but is doubtless fresh and new to thriller readers.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"At the same time Palvou introduces the SF elements of the story. He talks of genetics and retroviruses. He does that classic novice SF author thing of writing a paragraph in which the characters talk about technical stuff and following it with a paragraph explaining what they were talking about. (This is probably essential for thriller readers, and as I recall Michael Crichton does it a lot.) Very quickly it becomes clear that a showdown is in the offing because at long last civilization has progressed to the point whereby Athanatos can both understand how his own elixir works, and discover how Cyclades keeps coming back to haunt him without any medical intervention.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"I worried about the book for a long time, because there was something missing. Hollywood might think you can expunge the supernatural from the Trojan War, but no reputable author would attempt to do so. Thankfully Pavlou got there in the end, and it is this final addition to the mix that makes the ending crackle furiously.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"It took me quite a while to get into this book. There is a lot of stuff there purely for the benefit of the thriller audience and an experienced SF&F reader will find some of it tiresome. But by the end I started to get quite impressed, because I don’t think Pavlou was just writing a thriller, he was trying to say something about men.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,Of course you don’t expect much in the way of strong women characters in thrillers. But,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,Gene,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"is particularly notable for viewing its women through testosterone-tinted spectacles. Sure they are there, but they are all objects. Women are weak and unreliable, they are devious and treacherous, they cheat on their husbands, they are whores, they are hot, they are desirable, they are irresistible.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Cyclades himself is a complete shit. He spends ten years at war against Troy to win back his stolen wife, but it is very clear that he would have killed her in an instant had he thought that she had ""betrayed"" him by ""allowing"" a Trojan to have sex with her. Thankfully both his wife’s ghost and Helen get to whisper in his ear, though that is entirely for our benefit and does him no good at all.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"And let us not forget that the entire book is about the male wish for immortality through siring sons. Women are mere vessels in that process, and I’m rather surprised that Pavlou didn’t bring cloning into the equation to further emphasize the point. There are elements too that suggest that Cyclades, and maybe Athanatos as well, are deeply disturbed by the idea of androgyny. It is no accident that the goddess who sets Cyclades on his journey is Cybele. Presumably the whole role of women in the process of conception, all that combining of pernicious female DNA with the pure male strand, is deeply repugnant to them.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Overall, therefore, a very interesting book. A basic SF premise, some well-used fantasy elements, and in addition the way in which Detective North and his colleagues track down their perp is a nice piece of slow, painstaking police procedural. You might not find this book in the SF ghetto at bookstores, but it is worth looking out all the same.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"series, I was expecting more of the bleak and brutal tale that we had in the first volume. It is, after all, only the second volume, and if it were to follow the fantasy trilogy formula closely then book two should end with everything looking completely hopeless and the bad guys about the triumph. I wasn’t alone either. Some of Cobley’s characters had the same suspicions as to what was about to happen to them.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,"…she and Gilly and Medwin were due to leave by ship for Sejeend and from there overland to Scallow in Dalbar. ""An undertaking of some importance"" Bardow had called it, which probably meant they would encounter trials of unsurpassing horror and peril.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,Keren of course was right. Cobley does seem to save some his most horrible fates for the poor girl. But overall,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p i span  ,Shadowgod,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"is much lighter in tone than its predecessor and, without giving too much away, it doesn’t follow the formula that closely at all.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"That is a good thing. It is always nice to see a writer of epic fantasy trying to do something different. But in other ways Cobley falls foul of some of the classic traps of the sub-genre. The most obvious one is runaway escalation of magic. As soon as you start involving demons and demigods and gods in the plot you very quickly get to the point where your ordinary human characters can have very little influence on the outcome of events. OK, so this is fantasy, so we know that Good is going to triumph in the end. But it is nice to think that the heroes had some active part in this, rather than simply being brave and loyal vessels through which the Good Gods express their powers.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The other issue that I have with the book is excessive wolf-crying. If, as an author, you bring a major character back from the dead very quickly, then no reader is going to believe you when you kill off other characters. Especially if you bring them back from the dead as well.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,Other elements of the book are a lot more to my taste. Cobley’s world is rather more real than those of many fantasy books. There are merchants and farmers and peasants as well as nobility. Some of his characters spend a lot of time worrying about how the royal treasury is going to raise enough money to pay the troops when the country is ravaged by war. And I particularly like the fact that some of the problems his heroes face include greedy merchants trying to make a profit out of the war effort and racist violence between the various elements of the anti-Evil coalition.,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"I should also note that Cobley writes just the sort of battle scenes that Peter Jackson would love. Tolkien did his best to make his battles come over as believable medieval warfare. Very little magic was involved. But you could see from the movies that what Jackson wanted to film was a succession of ever more over the top special effects as one great spell topped the next. Cobley has just the stuff for him. There are fortresses that grow themselves out of the ground, magical war machines that can demolish mighty city walls in a single blow, and vast regiments of creatures that can only be rendered with sophisticated CGI. Jackson would love it.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"I’m certainly looking forward to reading the final volume in the series because, having seen what Cobley has done in book two, I have no idea what he is going to do next (well, other than bring back a bunch of characters we are supposed to think are dead). But at the same time I am just enough divorced from the book world to compare it two the real one. Cobley’s world has humanity uniting to face the menace of an Evil God who wants to destroy the world. In a fantasy novel that can be true. But in Iraq right now we have two groups of humans beating the hell out of each other because fanatics on both sides believe that the other side is working for an Evil God who wants to destroy them. Sometimes I think we are better off without fantasies.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"is that it contains a range of different types of story. There are two set in ancient Mongolia at the time of Genghis Khan. Two are what Sargent accurately describes in her afterword as ""Twilight Zone"" style stories. One is a straightforward ghost story used as a vehicle for exploring family relationships. The story ""Thumbprints"" is a crime story all about the villainous things that literary agents might get up to in order to make money out of authors whose careers are fading. And there are several straight SF stories. To my mind this simply highlights the breadth of Sargent’s talent, but I can see it would disturb those who prefer to only read certain types of story.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Then again, maybe it says a lot about me that it is the SF that interested me most.

Most SF writers tackling this idea (e.g. see Ken MacLeod’s",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,") assume that once we have Drexler machines that can make any goods we want then people will naturally seek out that which cannot be duplicated, for which read human creativity. But Sargent agues that this will not automatically be the case. Most people, she argues, will be so overwhelmed, and so spoiled, by living in a world of plenty that they will be too lazy too seek out excellence unless they are actively sold on the idea.

It is a depressing story, and echoes the themes from ""Originals"" and ""Venus Flowers at Night"" that humankind has become too lazy, or perhaps too fond of ""safety"" to dream about the future.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Let’s begin by putting something to rest. When people see an author start a publishing company they might be tempted to think, ‘vanity publishing’, but Storm is still a very successful writer.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Technically the company is a partnership, between us both.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The reason Gabriel and I started Immanion Press initially was to republish my out of print back catalogue novels. Unless you’re one of the very few ‘big name’ authors, you can’t expect to see your work staying in print for long, which is annoying for both writers and their loyal readers. At the beginning, I think both Gabriel and I just regarded IP as an extension of other services that we offer fans, but then other author friends began to get in touch with us, asking, ""will you do my back catalogue too?"" and then a few new authors sent us great manuscripts that we couldn’t bear not to publish!

We get so much amazing writing to look at, and sometimes I’m astounded that major publishers have turned it down. We’re very glad to be able to give these writers a chance.

Publishers want to publish new writers constantly, flinging wads of them at the wall in the hope that some will stick (i.e. sell).

You’re more likely to endure. Big publishers don’t support that, but small presses like IP do. We look on every book we bring out as ‘special’. We want every one of them to sell well.

It’s a sad state of affairs, but more and more established authors in this country, who have big followings, can no longer get published here.

There were a few areas I wanted to expand, to fit in with later ideas. As for specific content, which Gabriel mentioned, it’s more to do with me than any requirements of my publisher in the States.

I thought the books should come out again in the UK, since they’d been out of print for a long time. (The US edition is still in print.) The first thing that struck me was how bad the grammar was in book one, and how many plot holes there were… or rather the plot was extremely wobbly. I was itching to re-edit the books, using my experience as an editor of other writers’ work over the past ten years. My editor head just couldn’t bear the thought of these books coming out again in such bad shape! Anyway, to cut a long story short, once I realized I wasn’t going to get a UK publisher to look at Wraeththu stuff, of any kind, and Gabriel and I had decided to produce the first trilogy again ourselves, I got to work on them. Tor weren’t interested in the new editions, mainly I think because they’d just reprinted the Omnibus edition they have, and had a lot of them to sell.",1,10

There is also a lot more background material included to give the plot a backbone. I moved scenes around, and added more to give coherence and depth. For example, the end of book one was originally simply a newspaper report, outlining what had happened to Pellaz and Caeru in Immanion (the city in the books, not our press!). I thought, no, that won’t do, and rewrote the lot from Pell’s perspective. It added a couple more chapters to the end, but I think made the book a lot stronger.

I read so many where the characters behave in a totally unbelievable fashion, which jerks me out of the story and then the writer has lost me as a reader. I go for a strong, confident style, in which the author has a definite individual ‘voice’ that shines out from the first line of the book.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Yes, the major UK stores are controlled from the head office; the stores themselves have little or no autonomy.

Also, in my honest opinion, there has been nothing new in the industry for the past 10 years. I have role-played for over 20 years now and in my maturity as a role-player I want more than a sword wielding fighter or a gun-toting nut. This made me wonder how many other people out there are like me. Wraeththu offers a setting which is truly unique and styles around a more mature level of role-playing. At the end of the day, role-playing is a great pastime for people of any age. Some people find escapism in soap operas, but there is a bigger world out there and the infinite worlds of the mind, all of which can be explored through role-playing. Not to mention that role-playing in general can be used as a fun educational tool; this is ignored by many people. There is more information about the Wraeththu RPG on",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Yes, the fact that we have not tried to come up with the next big rule or dice mechanic. Out of the thousands of rules systems on the planet, everything has been done, and the best mechanics have stood the test of time. So we adopt and adapt the best ideas and add a few of our own. The biggest differences to mainstream rules systems are the combat and magic. The combat is deadly, and based around the character’s physical abilities, skill and type of weapon, as the concept of ‘you hit, I hit’ is a bit annoying. So in combat the characters that do best are the ones who think and use their abilities to their best advantage. For magic, I took a different approach. I did not want to have hundreds of spells; I wanted to have a system where you can do anything, providing you can describe how it works. We have explained in the book how magic functions in the world and what the characters cannot do. To that we have added a set of building blocks and the rest is down to how you play it.",1,10

To me, it’s like someone who has never worked on an oilrig trying to describe the minutiae of day-to-day events in such an environment. I can see the gaps and the holes and the misunderstandings. Real magic is not about special effects, or wizards zapping each other with spells.

This was more to do with the fact that I was still a novice myself at the time, working with various teachers to learn more. I wasn’t equipped then to create the system. However, nearly 20 years on, I am, so I spent a lot of time working everything out. It occurred to me that, from a Chaos Magic perspective, I’d created a system that was viable, and as workable as any other model. At one time, every magical system on Earth was new, and just because something is new doesn’t mean it isn’t valid. Wicca is a prime example of that. From the evidence I’ve read, I’m convinced Gerald Gardner made it all up in the 1950s, with help from others, cobbling together bits and pieces from other systems to create his own. This is not a criticism; the system was elegant and it worked. It still does. Also, even though H P Lovecraft was not into magic himself, several different systems have evolved based entirely on his fictional mythos — and they work too.

Some of them had known each other for years, but had never met in the flesh, as it were. As England was pretty central to where everyone lived, I said I’d try and find a venue. Then more people got to hear about it and eventually I realized I’d have to organize a proper event.

Anyway, at the end we all said we wished there was a way we could come back next year. So one of the Lunacon staff talked with the 2005 chairman and got us some funding and a room allocated, so we could do our track with them. As far as I’m aware we are the first track to be accepted at Lunacon and we will be back again in 2006.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"MonkeyBrain have done three very good things with their edition. Most importantly they have rescued a very good book from obscurity. Secondly they have given it an absolutely stunning John Picacio cover. And finally they have persuaded Moorcock to update the contents. Not that his conclusions needed any significant modification, but it has allowed him to include the younger generation of fantasy writers (Bishop, Ford, Miéville, Vandermeer, etc.) in his considerations. Also the book now includes a number of additional reviews and essays by Moorcock that he has produced since the original publication. And there is an introduction by China Miéville and an afterword by Jeff Vandermeer. All in all there is about 25-30% new material.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"However, as I said, Moorcock’s views have not needed much updating. The scourges of formula fantasy and comfort reading that he railed against back in the 80s have, if anything, got worse since that time.

""Where today?"" asked one, ""can you put an arm hold around a man’s throat and slip a knife into him between the third and fourth ribs and get away with it?"" The answer was, of course, that the Marines were still looking for recruits. Bu maybe he meant, ""Where can you do that and not have someone retaliate?""

First of all it is hugely depressing that there are people out there who have never heard of Chris Priest, Robert Sheckley and Jane Yolen. They need to go just to find out. But the important point is that this is not some tiny local convention where the only authors present are the guests. This is Worldcon. Authors are everywhere.",1,10
