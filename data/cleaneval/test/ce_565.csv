html body text p font span font span  ,"Grayling Love hasa fraternity, no table manners required.",1,8
html body text p span font span  ,"ValleyHigh School's monstrous lineman requires that interested members have twoprimary interests: Football and the need to throw down, as in large incrementsof food with little regard to style or tack. You know, treat every club meallike a pie-eating contest at the county fair.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Lovefounded the eat-and-be-merry group with teammate Josh O'Meara, and they slappedthe appropriate title on it: ""The Fat Boys."" Every so often the rotundgroup of 20 teenagers ambushes the Hometown Buffet in Laguna and bellies up.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""Oh,it's cool,"" Love said. ""We're proud of our fat. Our initiation fornewcomers is for them to take their shirts off and dig in on a plate of icecream and cookies. We have them dig in until the manager makes them put theirshirt back on because we're scaring the customers.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Truthbe told, Love is more substance than flab. He's a well put-together package ofsize -- 6-foot-3, 290 pounds -- agility and skill, and he's one of the mostheavily recruited linemen to come out of Sacramento. His first recruiting tripnext month is enough to make any high school athlete drool with envy: NotreDame.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Loveloads up on honors classes such as calculus, piles on the calories and thenunloads on the poor chap in front of him on game night.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Love'sextended fraternity -- and potential recruits to the college ranks and the""Fat Boys"" -- includes four additional movers and shakers in theSac-Joaquin Section Division I playoff field. If they haven't bumped belliesbefore, they surely must now to survive the coming weeks.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"ElkGrove's Mitch Quist, Nevada Union's Jason Leach and the Grant tonnage of JoeWolford and Izacc Ramirez share the same bond: Loud and proud, large and incharge. Each senior is a field-tilting jovial giant. Each is silly and quirky,attributes that belie their brutish Friday night behavior.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Andeach is motivated to bring his team a championship, the fuel coming from thestill-digesting eats on their favorite holiday -- Thankgiving.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""Ithink the coaches worry we might eat too much on Thanksgiving,"" Love said.""Sorry, but big guys have to eat.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Lovecould run into Leach on every snap tonight in a quarterfinal game at NevadaUnion. Like their counterparts, Love and Leach play both sides of the ball,clogging up holes as tackles or creating them with drive blocks.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"If Lovedoesn't wind up offering Leach a ""Fat Boys"" T-shirt, he'll surelynotice the hair.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Leach'smother, Carol, was only mildly surprised that she found her kitchen doubling asa mini-salon the other night. Leach, who normally has light brown hair, became afull-bore blond after a bleach job, then supervised the treatment of twoteammates he brought with him, Fred Anderson and Jake Curtis.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""Ithink the bigger they are, the sillier they become,"" Carol Leach said.""Jason's definitely flamboyant.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"He'salso an intriguing prospect. At 6-2 and 295, Leach has SAT scores similar tothat of Love's, in the 1,200 range.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""He'stoo big for our program,"" NU coach Dave Humphers said. ""We're used tohaving the 5-7, 165-pound linemen. But he's good. They must have family stock inCostco.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Quistgot into the hair thing back in the heat of September, before the opener againstNapa. The most seasoned lineman of the lot -- he's a third-year starter -- Quistthought the best way to usher in his final season would be to change hisbrownish locks to a blinding blond. As for motivation, we're not just talkingfootball here.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""Hey,the girls dig it,"" Quist said.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"A bruteat 6-1 and 265 pounds of fury, Quist can bring a weight room to a standstill. Hecan squat some 540 pounds, applying the leg strength that made him an All-Citywrestler last fall. He admits to being something of ""a savage,"" havingbusted six chin straps this season.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Quistonly has to look across the dinner table to discover the source of his zanypersonality. Older brother Mike used to do back flips at basketball games topump up the crowds. Now he coaches his kid brother on the finer points ofknocking people on their duffs.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Quistwas named homecoming king, an announcement that nearly brought him to tears.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"SaidMike: ""I was homecoming king here a few years ago. And, like Mitch, it wasbased on weight and good looks.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"AtGrant, practices are often laced with barbs between Wolford and Ramirez. But inthe heat of battle, few tandems are more potent or proven. They dominatedopponents down the stretch in leading the Pacers to the section championshiplast fall.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Tonightthey'll tangle with Quist and Co. for a berth in the City Championship gameagainst the winner of the Valley-NU contest.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"At 6-2and 310 pounds, Ramirez says he backs down to no man. Unless his name is MikeAlberghini. Ramirez was so smitten with the Grant coach that he pleaded with hisfamily to return him to Del Paso Heights so he could play for the Pacers,following a six-month stay in Southern California his sophomore year.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"A truehighlight came last year, when he was chewed on so hard by Alberghini that hecried.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""Ihave no problem with that,"" Ramirez said.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Ramirezand Wolford were assigned the task of being mentors to new linemen this fall.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,They'vedone it with equal parts teaching and humor.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Wolforddrives his coaches nuts with his constant yammering, about how skilled and toughhe is, how he can't wait to cash in on millions in the NFL, about how sleek and""sexy"" he looks now that he's slimmed down a bit.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Sure.From 276 last year to 275 now. His teammates crack that he's so hairy he's their""Teen Wolf.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Alberghinikeeps Wolford --,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"arguablythe top center in the region -- humble by saying he could make a lot of moneyhiring himself as a mascot -- ""He's Chuck E. Cheese without the ratcostume.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""That'sOK,"" Wolford says. ""Everyone knows who the best player is aroundhere.""",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Of thebunch, Love has no idea where he got his size. His mother, Catherine, is all of5-1. His dad, Grayling Sr., is barely 6-1. The closest either parent got tofootball in college was when Mom participated in the marching band at MichiganState.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Love'sathletic skills don't make a lot of sense, either. The first time Valley coachJay Whinery caught a glimpse of Love this summer, he asked his assistants toconfirm that Love had just jumped up and hung on the crossbar with nary aneffort.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Lastspring, Love earned team MVP honors in baseball, gassing opponents -- includingtop-ranked Laguna Creek -- with his nasty circle changeup. He cracked five homeruns and was a sight to behold chugging around the bases in a uniform thatlooked like it was painted on.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"""He'san incredible athlete, a freak of nature,"" Valley assistant coach AbeSnobar said. ""I mean, he can throw a football 50 yards. He was our kickerlast year. And he's humble about everything.""",1,7
