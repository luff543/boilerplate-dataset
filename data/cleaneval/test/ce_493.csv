html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The original RS232 standard was developed about 40 years ago and specifiesthat the maximum baud rate is 19,200 and the maximum cable length is 50feet. While that may have been good 20 years ago -- it's too short andslow today! Although today's computers are clocked to support much higherbaud rates -- technically you need to be careful. You also need to becareful about using long cable lengths. Many people have gotten 100 foot cables to work, the question isreliability. If we are using good quality cable and connectors and haveerror detection built into the protocol then we might go over the 19,200 and 50foot limits. Errors will be detected and we'll know how much of a problemit is. Otherwise we'll stick to the limits to minimize our risk or useRS422 or RS485.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"RS422 and RS485 use a balanced line approach that eliminates many problemswith RS232. For example Profibus is based on RS485 and Profibus runsat speeds up to 12 Mbaud (625 times faster than 19,200 baud). The problems with RS422 and RS485 is that the set-up is moredifficult: you have to use more expensive cable (for proper impedance andcapacitance), properly terminate the ends ofthe cables, set addresses, etc. But the advantages are longer cablelengths, higher baud rates, and multiple devices share the same communicationnetwork.",1,9

B&B Electronics products usually cost less but Black Box usually has higher quality. So for demos, training, testing purposes we typically use B&B equipment. For actual installations we typically use Black Box. (We want to minimize risk and those calls in the middle of the night). In all fairness to B&B Electronics, if you buy their products and all the separate options (isolation, surge protection, etc) that may be built-in to the Black Box equipment then you are at about the same price and quality as Black Box. You canusually find serial cables, 9 and 25 pin connectors, null modemadapters, tools, and gender changers at your local Radio Shack, computer store or order on-line.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td h2 span  ,Connection problems,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,There are typically three problems that you will experience while trying toconnect serial devices:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span span  ,25 pin or 9 pin connectors,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,Male and female connectors and cables,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,DCE and DTE,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,The RS232 standard started out with a 25 pin connector. Most RS232connectors today are 9 pins. Try to workwith 9 pin connectors when ever possible so convert 25 pin connectors to 9 pinconnectors using 25 pin to 9 pin adapters.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The second thing that will mess you up is whether the connectors aremale or female (pins or sockets). Therefore it helps to have an assortmentof gender changers (male to male, female to female). (Please -- no e-mails-- I'm not making any of this up). Gender changers comein both 9 pin and 25 pins. If you have changed everything from 25 pin to 9pin then you won't need many 25 pin gender changers.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,The third problem is DCE & DTE. If two serial ports bothtransmit on pin 2 and receive on pin 3 (i.e. they are both DTE) and you plug in a straight throughserial cable then you will transmit into the transmit pin(not the receive pin) on the other end and the other device can't receive the data. That is what null modem adaptersare for. Null modem adapters swap the wire connections on pins 2 and 3(and also the handshaking lines) so that the transmitter (pin 2) goes into the receiver (pin 3)of the other device. During the design phase you could worry yourself about this or you could just carry null modem adapters to theinstallation site with you. Plug in the serial cable. If it does not work theninsert the null modem adapter and then see if it works. Note that you canbuy serial cables either straight through or null modem (crossed).,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Another trick to is to buy 9 pin RS232 to RJ45 (modular connector) adapters and thenuse regular Ethernet cable to connect the adapters.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Most RS422 and RS485 connections are done using screw terminals. Therefore you don't have to worry about gender changers andadapters.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td h2 b span  ,Getting Started,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The first step is to get connected and test out all the low level stuff:cables, serial port hardware, serial port drivers, interrupt conflicts,etc. The best way to do this is to attach the serial cable between twocomputers and run the HyperTerminal communications program that comes withMicrosoft Windows (Start, Programs, Accessories, Communications, HyperTerminal). You run the HyperTerminal program on both computers and should be able to typemessages into the main text box and see them appear on the other computer. You can also send text files from one computer to the other. You can create smalltext files to send using Notepad. Just open Notepad type in some text andsave the file. Note that in HyperTerminalyou will have to specify the connection to be direct to COM1, COM2, ... whateverserial port you plugged the cable into. We would initially set thecommunications parameters (on both computers) to 9600 baud, no parity, 8 databits, 1 stop bit.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,If this does not work then try the following:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span span  ,Try inserting the null modem adapter,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,"Check computer's setup to see that the serial port is enabled and what COM port (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) it is configured for (hint: COM1 is address 3F8 hex and IRQ4, COM2 is address 2F8 hex and IRQ3, COM3 is address 3E8 hex and IRQ4, and COM4 is address 2E8 hex and IRQ3).",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,Check to make sure that infrared (IR) communications is not enabled on that COM port,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,Check to make sure that other devices are not interfering with that COM port and the interrupt is not being used. For example if you are trying to use COM1 and a modem is trying to use COM3 and you are both using interrupts then one or both programs will not function correctly.,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td h2 span  ,Handshaking,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"""Handshaking"", when talking about serial communications, is how one device tells another device that it is ready to receive data. There are several layers of handshaking. There are the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) / Data Set Ready (DSR) lines that indicate the other device is plugged in, powered up and is present. Then there is Request To Send (RTS) / Clear To Send (CTS) which indicates that the receiver has room in it's input buffer and is ready to accept data. Third, there is XON and XOFF. XON and XOFF are a method that one device can use the serial link to tell the other device to stop sending and then when to start sending again.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Suppose that there are two serial devices, A & B. Let's say that device A is a Pentium 4, 3 GHz with hyperthreading, lot's of memory and doing very little work. It can transmit and receive very fast. But device B is a special device with a CPU that is having to do a lot of other things and find time for serial communications. Also, device B might have a small receive buffer. So if device A were transmitting to device B then device A could transfer data much faster than device B could receive it. So device B would use handshaking to tell device A when to stop sending and then when to restart.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"RTS/CTS are hardware and require wires to carry these signals between devices. XON/XOFF are special characters sent over the serial link and do not require additional wires. XOFF is the character CTRL-S (ASCII code 19) and XON is the character CTRL-Q (ASCII code 17). For example, if you connect two computers with a serial cable and are able to type characters on one computer and see the characters appear on the other computer -- press CRTL-S (XOFF) on one computer to stop communications. Type on the other computer and you should see that the characters are not transmitted. Once you press CTRL-Q (XON) the characters should show up because they were held at the transmitting computer until XON was sent by the receiving computer.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"What if one device requires hardware handshaking and the other device can not supply it? You must ""jumper out"" the hardware handshaking lines by wiring the RTS/CTS lines together and the DTR/DSR lines together. Note that some serial ports that use DTR & DSR also use Carrier Detect (CD) and will want the CD line tied into the DTR and DSR lines.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,. There are twogeneral classes of operation:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span span  ,The device automatically sends you the data once every time period or test. For example once a second or at the end of every test.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,You have to poll the device to get it to send the data,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The two items that determine the difficulty of implementing your ownprotocol are the number of commands youhave to program and timing issues. Sending one command that returns onecommand (set of values) from the device is simple. Having to program many commands withdifferent possible responses becomes challenging.

There are a lot of commandsyou can send to a device using these protocols and there are typically more thanone response you need to handle.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The other challenging problem can be timing. Many protocols havetiming requirements. For example you have a maximum time betweencharacters and messages. If you take longer than the maximum time, thereceiver has ""timed out"" and you have to start all over again. Today's processors are fast enough that this is not usually a problem. Butif you are sending a single character, running code to figure out the nextcharacter, then sending another character, etc. and having a communicationsproblem -- try building the entire character string in memory first and thensending the entire string out the serial port at one time. This reducesthe time between characters.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td h2 span  ,Typical Protocols,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"We will discuss two types of protocols: simple and complete. Asimple protocol would something like ""value"" and then a carriage return",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span cr  ,. The carriage return,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span cr cr  ,"denotes the end of the message. For example if you are reading values from a device and you getthe number 1 then is the actual value that the device is sending you 1, 10,1000, or any other number that starts with one? When you receive the",1,11

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Note that the,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span cr  ,serves another purpose. What happens if you look in your serial input buffer and it has a lot of data in it? How do you know where to start reading data? The trick is to start reading characters until you read a,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span cr cr  ,. Then throw all those previous characters away (since you don't know if they are a complete message or not). So the,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span cr cr cr  ,serves as both the start and the end of a message.,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"What if the device is sending multiple values, such as temperature andpressure? Then the protocol might be 115,128CR. So now the receiverstarts reading a 1, then another 1, then a 5, then a comma, then a 1, 2, 8, andfinally a carriage return. The logic in the receiver says read the firstvalue until you reach a comma and then start reading the second value until youreach the carriage return.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"So far the simple protocol is great -- except what happens when thetemperature is 115 and the pressure is 128 but data is ""garbled"" inthe transmission (when a big 200 hp motor starts up) and the receiver receives115,28",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span cr  ,"and shuts down the process because the pressure dropped to 28 PSI? How is the receiver to know when the data is not correct? Thatis why ""complete"" protocols are used -- they have more error detectionbuilt in.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"What we call a ""complete"" protocol is one that typically has aStart Of Text (STX), sender address, receiver address, number of data values,the data being sent, End Of Text (ETX), checksum, and then requires some form ofacknowledgement from the receiver.

html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,"The number of data values, (bytes or words) tells the receiver how many bytes of data should be received.

If the fifteenth byte is not the ETX character then the receiver knows that it did not receive a correct message and returns a negative acknowledgement (NAK) to the sender.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,"The receiver runs the checksum algorithm on the data received and compares the receiver's calculated checksum to the checksum sent by the sender.

html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,"After all the checks are done on the receiver end, the receiver sends an ACK or NAK back to the sender to tell the sender the status.

html body text table tbody tr td h2 span  ,Serial Client & Server Example Programs,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,We have written client and server examples that implement some protocolfunctionality. The protocol is:,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"On the transmit (server) side it is simple to create the outgoing stringby simply concatenating the string.

The firststate is ""Waiting for STX"" and the second state is called either""Reading Data Values"" or ""Waiting for ETX"". So we waitfor a STX character to be received. When a STX character is received westart ""recording"" the incoming characters. Then we stop""recording"" incoming characters when a ETX character isreceived. Once the ETX character is received we send the""recorded"" string of data values to a parsing routine that picks outthe individual values. Then the receive cycle (state machine) starts overwaiting for STX.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td ol li span  ,"IF you can, when reading and writing to a device, group the data into large blocks of data. For example, if you need to read 20 temperatures from a PLC that are spread throughout the PLC memory, use PLC ""move"" commands to copy the temperatures to one continuous block of memory. Now your program doing the reading only needs one read command of twenty values instead of twenty read commands of one value. Overall system performance will be much faster.",1,10
