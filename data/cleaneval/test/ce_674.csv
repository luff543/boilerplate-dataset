html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"]. Single global estimates of intervention costs are not relevant to individual countries. On the other hand, very few countries are able to estimate the costs of all possible interventions in their settings. WHO-CHOICE is, therefore, assessing the costs and effects of a range of interventions for 14 epidemiologic sub regions of the world. The provision of sub-regional estimates allows interventions to be classified into broad categories for decision-making that have broad validity across that set of countries – e.g. those that are very cost-effective, those that are cost-effective, and those that are cost-ineffective. Policy-makers can then ask if there are good reasons why very cost-effective interventions are not done in their setting, while at the same time cost-ineffective interventions are being done",1,10

In the future, WHO-CHOICE will provide technical assistance to selected countries interested in applying the tools of generalized cost-effectiveness analyses",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Costs can be divided into 'patient costs' and non-patient or 'programme costs'. Patient costs refer to all costs at the point of delivery such as outpatient visits, bed days, drugs, or laboratory tests.

The components include such items as administration, training or media campaigns",1,10

For the option of completely ambulatory short course chemotherapy with daily supervision, programme costs accounted for 33%, 16% and 34% of estimated total costs in Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania in turn. These findings suggest that programme costs can be a substantial proportion of total costs, and that the proportion may well vary across settings. They also mean that using a simple rule of thumb in which programme costs are assumed to be a fixed percentage of patient costs may not always be appropriate – although probably preferable than ignoring this category of cost completely",1,10

The first part discusses the theoretical approach for defining relevant costs. The second and third parts document the methods used to determine the amount of resource use and their prices.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Observed prices or charges do not necessarily reflect economic value. Generally, the economic definition of costs should be used in cost valuation, not the accounting (or financial) definition.

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"]. The concept implies that all resources consumed by an intervention should be valued, not just those constituting a budgetary line item.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"In collecting costs, several basic issues concerning the costing process arise. The following issues outline the approach used to determine costs.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Joint or overhead costs,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Programme cost analysis to inform decisions at the sectoral level requires information on the costs of introducing each intervention singly and also in combination with other related interventions. This requires identifying all resources involved to establish and run each intervention, including the necessary overheads.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,The simplest way to identify intervention-specific overhead costs is to identify shared resources used by the different interventions and use joint costing rules or some basis of allocation related to the usage of the overhead item,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,[,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a span  ,8,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"]. The percentage of time devoted to each individual intervention was used to allocate personnel costs and the share of equipment used. Similarly with buildings and vehicles, the proportion of intervention-specific utilization to total utilization was used",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,[,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a span  ,8,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,",",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a span  ,13,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"]. This implies that the resources are divisible, or can be shared across interventions (e.g. it is feasible to use 0.2 vehicles for an individual intervention). This is appropriate since most resources can be shared across interventions and programmes, and particular types of personnel, transport, and buildings can be hired in the short term or rented out to other users. In theory, all costs related to a set of evaluated interventions could be allocated. However, WHO-CHOICE excludes two major types of 'ongoing' costs in this context. First, some of the costs of central administration are not included – those that are part of the overall planning and management of the health system that are unrelated to the development and implementation of particular interventions aimed at improving health. Second, the current level of education of health professionals is excluded; if the skills required to deliver an intervention are available in the country under study, training costs to develop those skills are not included in the programme costs since a reallocation of health system resources does not affect these costs.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Capacity utilization,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,",",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td font p a span  ,8,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"]. Capacity utilization is defined as the proportion of the total target workload time a resource is actually used; for example, a computer used 5 hours in a 10 hour work day has a capacity utilisation of 50%. In comparing the cost-effectiveness of interventions, it is important to ensure that the observed differences are due to the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention rather than the extent to which capital and labor have been utilized in the environment in which the interventions were evaluated. WHO-CHOICE seeks to inform policy-makers on the optimum mix of interventions if health resources could be reallocated. It is not useful to perform this analysis by analyzing some interventions that are delivered inefficiently and others delivered efficiently. Therefore, for this analysis we report the cost-effectiveness estimates of interventions that are done efficiently, using 80% capacity utilization as the norm. This is consistent with recommendations made in CEA guidelines and ensures the comparability of cost-effectiveness ratios across interventions and settings",1,10

Further activities included basic administration, monitoring, evaluation, and supervision, passage of legislation, training, and law enforcement. Other activities relevant only to one or a few programmes were entered separately. Training was divided into the costs involved in setting-up and running a specific training session, and the costs of overseeing and administering a training programme. The former costs are considered to vary with the number of trainees and length of training, while the latter were considered a fixed cost needed to run any training programme, no matter how many trainees or the length of training.
