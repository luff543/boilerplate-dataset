The plains are much more warmer than the hills and as the train climbs up the mountains the climate gets much colder. Therefore it is advisable to keep warm clothes handy as one needs them. Leaving New Jalpaiguri station the train passes through the outskirts of Siliguri town and reaches Siliguri station. After a short halt the train leaves Siliguri station and crosses the Mahanadi bridge over the Mahanadi river which flows from the Himalayan foothills.",1,19
