html body text p font big strong big span  ,HOW TO WIN BEFORE THE BOARD OFEQUALIZATION,1,9
html body text p span  ,"Actually, the title is a little misleading; because you can't always win,but if you have good reasons for your appeal this information should help you present yourcase.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The Board of Equalization was created by the Legislature to give citizensan opportunity to contest the Assessor's valuation of their property. However, theLegislature realized that counties get most of their revenue from property taxes, and ifit was easy to get the valuation reduced counties would soon run out of money. TheLegislature handled this by saying in effect ""Ok, you have the right to appeal yourvaluation but we're going to make it an uphill battle for you to win.""",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The Legislature accomplished this by saying, ""The Assessor'svaluation is assume to be correct. In order for the taxpayer to win his appeal hemust show by",1,5
html body text p strong span  ,"Clear, Cogent, and Convincing Reasoning",1,6
html body text p span  ,"that the Assessorhas made a mistake."" Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence means a quantum ofproof which is less than beyond a reasonable doubt, but more than a mere preponderance ofthe evidence. It is the quantum of evidence necessary to convince the trier of factthat the ultimate fact in issue is ""highly probably."" Most Boards ofEqualization take this to mean that the taxpayer's evidence must make it pretty obviousthat the Assessor made a mistake. The key word in the last sentence is the word""evidence"". You must give good evidence to support your appeal.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Let me give you an example. You and your next door neighbor get aletter from the Assessor informing you that the value of each house has risen to $75,000. Both houses are identical and both of you fill an appeal before the Board ofEqualization. Your neighbor comes before the Board and says, ""This assessmentis ridiculous; my house can't possibly be worth more than $55,000. I only paid$35,000 for it seven years ago. I plan to live the rest of my life in this house. I'm not going to sell it to make a fast buck!""",1,5
html body text p span  ,"When it is your turn to go before the Board, you say, ""Thisassessment is ridiculous; my house can't be worth more than $55,000."" Then youshow the Board that three other houses in the area have been sold in the last year. The house that was identical to yours sold for $54,000, another house that is similar toyours sold for $56,000. The last house, which was better than yours, sold for$66,000. You show the Board that no houses in the area have sold for more than$66,000. Now this is a pretty simple example by 99 times out of 100 the Board ofEqualization will rule in the following manner: you win your appeal, but yourneighbor's appeal is denied. The reasoning behind these two rulings is this: your neighbor did not present any evidence that supported his contention that the Assessormade a mistake, on the other hand you gave some good hard evidence that supported yourappeal.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Let me explain about the sort of evidence that Boards of Equalization likeand don't like to see. If you tell us that your roof leaks and that there is waterdamage in the house, bring us some pictures that show the damage. Bring an estimatefrom a contractor showing how must it will cost to fix the roof. If your foundationis cracked and the floor is buckled, bring some estimates of the cost to repaireverything. Bring us pictures that backup your contentions. If the Assessorsays your house is worth $50,000 and you have tried for the last year to sell the housefor $45,000 and had no offers, bring a letter from your Realtor confirming it. Showus that a house similar to yours, sold for a good deal less than the assessed value ofyour house. The Board of Equalization is delighted to see good hard evidence.",1,5
html body text p span  ,The Board is not impressed with appeals based on emotion. Don't jumpup and down about the percent of tax increase. It doesn't matter what the percentageof increase is as long as the marketplace will support the value. Don't tell us thatyour grandfather bought the property for $100 fifty years ago and that you have nointentions of ever selling out just to make a buck. The Board could care less aboutyour intentions; the only thing we care about is the present market value.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The best place to get sales information is the Assessor's office. All recorded sales in the county are available there. It will take time and energybut the information is available to you. The easiest way to get another appraisal isto hire a fee appraiser. The fee appraiser can do all the work for you. Thedownside to hiring a fee appraiser is the cost. In addition, the fee appraiser'sreport may or may not support your appeal.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"There are three methods for determining the market value of a piece ofproperty: the Direct Sales Comparison method, the Cost Approach to Value, and theIncome Approach to Value. While each method has its strengths and weaknesses, thedirect sales comparison method generally carries the most weight. Almost anyone canuse the direct sales comparison method; all the information you need can be found in theAssessor's office. If you are going to use the cost approach or the income approachit might be wise to take to your accountant and an attorney.",1,5
html body text p span  ,Bring us an argument based only on emotion and outrage and you won't havea chance; bring us some good hard persuasive evidence and the Board may be able to grantyour appeal.,1,5
