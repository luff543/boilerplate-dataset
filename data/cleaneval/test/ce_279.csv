html body text div div p span  ,"Back then, it was popular in conservative circles to blame leftist guerrillas (or in Al Haig's case, a ""sinister third force"") for many Central American atrocities.

html body text div div p i span  ,"In the majority of massacres there is evidence of multiple acts of savagery, which preceded, accompanied or occurred after the deaths of the victims. Acts such as the killing of defenceless children, often by beating them against walls or throwing them alive into pits where the corpses of adults were later thrown; he amputation of limbs; the impaling of victims; the killing of persons by covering them in petrol and burning them alive; the extraction, in the presence of others, of the viscera of victims who were still alive; the confinement of people who had been mortally tortured, in agony for days; the opening of the wombs of pregnant women, and other similarly atrocious acts, were not only actions of extreme cruelty against the victims, but also morally degraded the perpetrators and those who inspired, ordered or tolerated these actions.",1,8

html body text div div p span  ,What did the U.S. State Department's Human Rights Desk (then occupied by Iran-Contra criminal Elliot Abrams),1,7

html body text div div p span  ,about conditions in Guatemala?,1,7
html body text div div p i span  ,"Praising the . . . government's ""increased sensitivity to human rights questions,"" the administration's annual review of Guatemala's human rights record in 1984 concedes that ""sporadic abuse still does occur at the local command level.""",1,8

html body text div div p span  ,And what does Gen. Rios Montt have to say about his past?,1,7
html body text div div p i span  ,"Do you want me to start crying or get gastritis about it? I am not [a devil]. If I were, I wouldn't be here."" He said that even if military atrocities occurred, he would not necessarily have known about them. ""I was president, not a platoon commander,"" he said.",1,8

html body text div div p span  ,But Rios Montt's comeback campaign still faces a few hurdles. One is a pesky amendment to the Guatemalan constitution that bans coup plotters (strike one) and dictators (strike two) from running for president.,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"Of course, with the help of family and friends, such barriers can be overcome. A more serious obstacle could be the Bush Administration, which has no desire to see old Central American dictators -- not to mention memories of old Iran-Contra conspiracy charges -- dredged up again.",1,7
