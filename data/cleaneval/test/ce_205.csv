html body text div div div p span  ,"In many cases I�m seeing that the technology (or, more accurately, the people using the technology) is driving business decisions. This, to me anyway, is totally backwards. A classic cart before the horse situation. It reminds me of a �dot-bomb� experience I had awhile back. I worked for a company who would let their testing department dictate the release schedule. Sure this was great for the geeks who felt they always needed more time, and simply �couldn�t conform to marketing�s aggressive schedule.� But it drove the rest of the company crazy.",1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"I always thought this was bullshit. I mean, shouldn�t business people make business decisions? If you can�t handle the workload, hire more people.

html body text div div div p span  ,99% of the time I hear someone crow about not being able to do something it sure as heck can be done. Sadly oftentimes instead of actually getting done it gets half-assed or compromised in someway and this more often than not causes failure for the project. You can usually chalk that up to poor decision-making or ego.,1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"And why to companies insist on riding a technology until the bitter end? I mean if it�s really a hinderance and you know it�s going to fail, wouldn�t it make sense to kill it and go a new direction sooner rather than later? I�ve seen millions (yes, millions) wasted on a poor choice of technology.",1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"I think this is usually an attitude problem, cultivated by having to deal with poorly developed technology. There are a few ways around this.

html body text div div div div p span  ,"I could go on and on about the circumstances, reasons, etc. But the fact remains, in my company, IT didn�t push back enough against the business people, we let them make the decisions to begin with - �business needs drive technology selection, not the other way around�. In my companies� case, it didn�t exactly work out. I know this is an exception, but thought I�d share.",1,9

But, again, it comes down to a people problem in the end, doesn�t it? Sounds like you�re IT people have a bit of a communication issue with the business people.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"You�re situation is probably pretty common, but a whole other issue. I think ideally the business people would make business decisions and IT would take those decisons and make the the appropraite technological desisions.

html body text div div div div p span  ,"If there�s one thing I�ve learned, it�s NEVER tell someone that their estimated timeline is wrong, except to say that it�s too short. If you�re unlucky, you�ll scare them into saying that it can be done quicker.",1,9
