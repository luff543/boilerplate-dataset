html body text table tbody tr td div p b font span  ,INTRODUCTION,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"4.1 There are a number of measures and classifications related to employment. Those discussed in this chapter include: status in employment; occupation; hours of work; full-time/part-time status; permanent/temporary/casual status; adult/junior status; managerial/non-managerial status; employment type; and other measures of working arrangements including details of shift work, overtime etc.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p b font span  ,STATUS IN EMPLOYMENT,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"4.2 The status in employment classification is available from most ABS household surveys producing estimates of employment, including the Labour Force Survey, the Census of Population and Housing, and most Special Social Surveys. The status in employment classification is not available from business surveys producing estimates of employee jobs. However, as discussed in",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p a font span  ,Chapter 3,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,", estimates of employee jobs from business surveys are related to, but not the same as, estimates of persons in paid employment (employees) from household surveys.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,4.3 The Australian status in employment classification is based on the ILO's resolution (Fifteenth ICLS 1993) concerning the International Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE-93). The ICSE classifies job holders according to the type of economic risk held between the job holder and other persons or legal organisations. The distinction between paid employment jobs and self-employment jobs is central to the classification. Paid employment (employee) jobs are those where remuneration is not directly dependent on the profits of the unit for which the job holder works. Self-employment jobs are those jobs where remuneration depends directly on the profits (or future profits) derived from the goods and services produced. The ICSE distinguishes five groups: employees (paid employment jobs) and four types of self employment jobs: employers; own account workers; contributing family workers; and members of producers' cooperatives.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"4.4 The Australian status in employment classification classifies job holders according to their perception of the relationship between themselves and the enterprise for which they work, together with the legal status of the enterprise where this can be established. The ICSE group ""members of producers' cooperatives"" is excluded from the Australian classification due to its lack of relevance in the Australian context. The groups distinguished in the Australian classification are:",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div ul li font span  ,"employee - a person who works for a public or private employer and receives remuneration in wages, salary, a retainer fee from their employer while working on a commission basis, tips, piece-rates, or payment in kind; or a person who operates his or her own incorporated enterprise with or without hiring employees;",1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div ul li font span  ,"employer - a person who operates his or her own unincorporated economic enterprise or engages independently in a profession or trade, and hires one or more employees;",1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div ul li font span  ,"own account worker - a person who operates his or her own unincorporated economic enterprise or engages independently in a profession or trade, and hires no employees; and",1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div ul li font span  ,contributing family worker - a person who works without pay in an economic enterprise operated by a relative.,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.5 The legal status concept is used to classify owner-managers of incorporated businesses as employees rather than as employers or own account workers, for consistency with Australian National Accounts practice. Individuals who work in their own business are queried about the legal status of the business. Although they may 'own' the business, if it is incorporated the individual is not held personally liable for the economic enterprise should it become insolvent. Those individuals who own an incorporated business, with or without hiring one or more employees, are therefore classified as employees. If the business is unincorporated (and hence the owner is liable for the economic enterprise), those who hire employees are classified as employers and those who do not are classified as own account workers.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.6 The Australian status in employment classification is illustrated in diagram 4.1.,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td div b font span  ,OCCUPATION,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.7 The occupation classification used in ABS surveys is the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) Second Edition 1996. Occupation data are available from the Labour Force Survey (quarterly), a number of supplementary topics to the Labour Force Survey, and most Special Social Surveys as well as the five-yearly Census of Population and Housing.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.8 ASCO is a skill-based classification of occupations which covers all jobs in the Australian workforce. Occupation information collected in surveys and the Census provides a description of a person's job and refers to the kind of work undertaken by an employed person irrespective of the industry in which that job is held. Jobs and occupations are fundamental concepts to the classification. A job is a set of tasks designed to be performed by one individual. An occupation is a set of jobs with similar sets of tasks. Occupations are classified according to two criteria - skill level and skill specialisation.,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.9,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div b font span  ,Skill level,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"is a function of the range and complexity of the set of tasks involved. The greater the range and complexity of the set of tasks, the greater the skill level of the occupation. The criteria used in ASCO Second Edition to measure skill level are the formal education and/or training and previous experience usually required for entry to the occupation.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.10,1,10

Skill specialisation is used to group occupations according to type, rather than level of skill.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.11 The structure of ASCO Second Edition comprises five hierarchical levels: Major Groups (the broadest level), Sub-Major Groups, Minor Groups, Unit Groups and Occupations (the finest level).

html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.13 Information on hours of work enables: classification of employed persons according to the number of hours worked; classification of employed persons into full-time and part-time status; and the identification of underemployed persons. The general notion of hours of work encompasses a number of related concepts: usual hours worked; hours actually worked; normal hours of work; and hours paid for (including both normal hours and overtime hours).,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div b font span  ,USUAL HOURS OF WORK,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.14 Usual hours of work refers to a typical period rather than to a specified reference period. The concept of usual hours applies both to persons at work and to persons temporarily absent from work, and is defined as the hours worked during a typical week or day. Actual hours worked (for a specific reference period) may differ from usual hours worked due to illness, vacation, strike, overtime work, a change of job or similar reasons.",1,10

Where not fixed by or in pursuance of laws or regulations, collective agreements or arbitral awards, normal hours of work should be taken as meaning the number of hours per day or week in excess of which any time worked is remunerated at overtime rates or forms an exception to the rules or custom of the establishment relating to the classes of workers concerned"". In the ABS, normal hours of work are defined as those set down in awards or formal agreements or standard hours of work in the industry or, where these do not exist, 35 hours per week.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.25 Measures of normal hours of work are not produced by the ABS. However, the concept is used in the full-time/part-time status classification in ABS business surveys.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div b font span  ,FULL-TIME/PART-TIME STATUS,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.26 The notion of what constitutes a standard full-time working week has required continual re-examination over the last 40 years with the progressive decline in standard hours of work, accompanied by a substantial growth in the number of persons employed under part-time working arrangements.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.27 In the absence of any internationally accepted definition of part-time work, two approaches have been taken in various countries. The first is objective and is based on the number of hours worked. The second is more subjective and involves classifying workers as full-time or part-time based on the self-assessment of the person concerned irrespective of the number of hours actually worked. The former approach is relatively simple to apply without requiring the respondent to know details about their contractual arrangements on hours worked, but provides no flexibility to accommodate variations in 'normal' hours of work in different industries and occupations. The self-assessment approach does accommodate such differences but is subjective, and its accuracy is dependent on respondents' knowledge of whether they work full-time or part-time in their activity. Both approaches are used in ABS surveys.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.28 The full-time/part-time status classification differs from, and should not be confused with, the permanent/casual classification. While the classification of full-time and part-time work is based on hours worked, the permanent/casual classifications used in ABS household and business surveys are not. In ABS business surveys the classification of employee jobs as permanent, temporary or casual is based on entitlements to paid leave and the length of employment contracts. Traditionally, ABS household surveys have classified employees as permanent or casual based on their entitlements to paid leave. However, more recently an additional criterion, on whether an employee perceives their job to be casual, has been used to classify employees as self-identified casuals. The permanent/casual classifications used in ABS business and household surveys are discussed later in this chapter.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div b font span  ,ABS HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.29 The approach used in the Labour Force Survey and adopted in many other ABS household surveys is to define full-time and part-time status in terms of hours worked. The definition used designates full-time workers as persons who (a) usually work 35 hours or more per week in all jobs, or (b) although usually working less than 35 hours a week, actually worked 35 hours or more during the reference week. Part-time workers are those who usually work less than 35 hours per week, and either did so during the reference week, or were not at work in the reference week. Under this definition, persons with more than one job are defined as full-time if they work more than 35 hours across all of their jobs.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.30 A subjective approach based on respondents' perception of their full-time or part-time status is used in some supplementary topics to the Labour Force Survey, and in some Special Social Surveys. This approach is most often used where information is sought about work that is not currently being undertaken and where recall problems may be encountered using a more objective approach (e.g. for jobs held 12 months prior to the survey date). It is also sometimes used to determine the full-time or part-time status of each job held by multiple job holders.",1,10

Employees who were entitled to either paid holiday or paid sick leave (or both) in their main job have been classified as permanent, while employees who were entitled to neither have been classified as casual. This method of identifying permanent and casual employees was simple and objective, and reflected long established definitions of permanent and casual employees used in Australia's industrial relations systems where, under the awards system, casuals were paid loadings in lieu of entitlements to paid holiday leave and paid sick leave. Changes to the leave entitlements of casuals from the late 1990s, where casuals are increasingly entitled to various forms of paid leave, have meant that the classification of permanent and casual employees based solely on paid leave entitlements is no longer appropriate. From late 2000, the terms 'permanent' and 'casual' will no longer be used in ABS household surveys to describe employees with and without leave entitlements. The term 'permanent' will be replaced with the term 'with leave entitlements', and 'casual' will be replaced with the term 'without leave entitlements'.",1,10

Employees who were entitled to either paid holiday or sick leave (but not both) and who did not consider their job to be casual were classified as 'other employed persons'. Also classified as 'other employed persons' were: employees who were entitled to neither paid holiday leave nor paid sick leave and who did not consider their job to be casual; and owner managers of unincorporated enterprises who did not invoice or bill for own payment and paid Pay As You Earn tax.,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"). In the survey, employee jobs are classified according to respondents' perception of the permanent, temporary or casual nature of the job. To assist respondents to classify jobs, some information is provided on the survey questionnaire about each type of job. Permanent jobs are described as jobs with paid annual and sick leave entitlements. Temporary jobs are described as jobs with some leave entitlements but with a short-term employment contract. Casual jobs are described as jobs with higher rates of pay, to compensate for lack of permanency and leave entitlements.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.42 The adult/junior classification is only available from ABS labour-related business surveys. In these surveys, adults are defined as employees aged 21 years or over, and employees who are paid at the adult rate regardless of their age (e.g. employees aged under 21 years may be paid at the full adult rate for their occupation). Juniors are employees aged under 21 years who are not paid at the adult rate of pay for their occupation.

html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.50 There are some important differences in the way in which people are classified to employment type categories in the 1998 Forms of Employment Survey and the Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation.

html body text table tbody tr td div ul li b font span  ,"Working in own unincorporated enterprise, and did not invoice or bill for own payment, and reported paying PAYE tax",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td div ul li font span  ,"- in the Forms of Employment Survey, this group was treated in a similar manner to employees excluding owner managers of incorporated enterprises. These workers were classified to different employment type categories according to their entitlements to paid leave and whether they considered their jobs to be casual. Thus these workers may be classified as 'employees with leave entitlements', 'self-identified casuals' or 'other employed persons'. In the Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation, these workers were retained in the category 'owner managers of unincorporated enterprises'.",1,12
