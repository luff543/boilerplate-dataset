html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p a span  ,Paul Kerr,1,15
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"After a fresh series of provocative North Korean actions, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Christopher Hill traveled to China, Japan, and South Korea late last month in another effort to restart six-party talks designed to eliminate Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. The talks, which also include Russia, have been stalled for nearly a year.",1,14

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span span  ,Arms Control Today,1,15
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"that recent North Korean statements, along with a modest amount of new intelligence, have increased U.S. officials’ concern that North Korea may test nuclear weapons. Pyongyang has not tested such weapons, although it has threatened to do so.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In addition, a senior North Korean diplomat said April 18 that Pyongyang had halted the operation of its five-megawatt nuclear reactor, an action that could permit it to obtain additional plutonium for use as fissile material in nuclear weapons. The announcement came approximately two months after North Korea announced that it possesses nuclear weapons.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The United States believes that North Korea possesses one or two plutonium-based nuclear weapons and may possess enough fissile material for several more. Whether Pyongyang is in the process of augmenting its purported nuclear arsenal, however, remains unclear.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span span  ,Talks,1,15
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Administration and congressional sources confirmed an April 25 Wall Street Journal report that the United States sent an urgent diplomatic message to allies earlier in the month notifying them of U.S. concerns that North Korea might conduct a nuclear test. The message also asked at least certain talks participants, such as China and South Korea, to urge Pyongyang to refrain from provocative behavior.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The other participants have been more supportive of engaging North Korea than has the United States. Nevertheless, South Korean Foreign Minster Ban Ki-moon warned North Korea against testing April 25, stating that such an act would result in Pyongyang’s “isolation.”",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The congressional source said the other countries would likely follow suit, but perhaps not publicly.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Although conveying impatience with Pyongyang’s behavior, U.S. officials continued to express support for the talks. Department of State spokesperson Adam Ereli acknowledged April 25 that “the stalemate has gone on…longer than any of us would have liked” but “vehemently” denied that administration officials are “at the end of our rope on this.”",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In an April 28 news conference, President George W. Bush also indicated continued U.S. support for the talks, adding that other actions, such as involving the UN Security Council in the matter, would depend on other participants’ support. China, which has veto power on the Security Council, and South Korea have resisted asking that body to take up the issue.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The duration of the current diplomatic track “is dependent upon our consensus amongst ourselves,” Bush said.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"For its part, North Korea continues to express a willingness to return to the talks, albeit under certain conditions.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Pyongyang says it wants the United States to end its “hostile policy” toward North Korea, express a willingness to accept peaceful coexistence with the current regime, and retract Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s reference to the government as one of several “outposts of tyranny” during her January 2005 confirmation hearings.",1,14

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Perhaps significantly, North Korean officials have also hinted that Pyongyang may change its stance on discussing its suspected uranium-enrichment program. The congressional source, as well as a witness to at least one such discussion, told",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span span  ,Arms Control Today,1,15
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,that these officials have suggested to unofficial interlocutors within the past several months that Pyongyang is willing to discuss U.S. concerns about the program in private bilateral talks.,1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Suspicions that North Korea is pursuing the capability to enrich uranium have played a central role in the current nuclear crisis. The standoff began in October 2002 after a visiting U.S. delegation accused Pyongyang of pursuing such a program covertly. North Korean officials admitted as much, U.S. officials said later, but Pyongyang has denied that it made such an admission. Highly enriched uranium and plutonium are the two types of fissile materials used in nuclear weapons.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The issue has also become a major point of contention in the six-party talks. During the last round, the United States insisted that North Korea disclose and dismantle the program, but the North Korean delegation denied that it has such a program and refused to discuss the matter. Pyongyang has not publicly changed this position.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The United States has said repeatedly that it will not engage North Korea in bilateral negotiations, although it has met privately with the North Koreans during the six-party talks.",1,14

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"According to the congressional source, the United States has identified “about half a dozen” possible North Korean nuclear testing sites and has recently seen “foggy” indications that Pyongyang may be preparing to test. However, South Korea’s National Security Adviser Kwon Jin-ho dismissed reports of such preparations in an April 27 radio interview, stating that “no unusual [North Korean] moves have been detected.”",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Washington’s concerns stem mainly from Pyongyang’s recent provocative statements, rather than any new intelligence, the administration official said.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"A March 31 North Korean Foreign Ministry statement describing the country as a “full-fledged nuclear weapons state” is one such example. Speaking to reporters April 27 in Beijing, Hill voiced concern about what North Korea “might do to further demonstrate that [status],” Reuters reported.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Hill’s warning came three days after North Korean Army Staff Chief Kim Yong Chun further escalated the tension, stating that Pyongyang will “steadily bolster its nuclear deterrent force,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The extent to which a nuclear test would advance North Korea’s weapons capabilities is unclear. According to an August 2003 CIA assessment, North Korea has “validated” designs for simple fission nuclear weapons without conducting “yield-producing nuclear tests.”",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"U.S. officials are also concerned about a reported North Korean threat to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists. North Korea expert Selig Harrison told reporters April 9 that, during a recent meeting, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan said Pyongyang might give nuclear weapons to terrorists if “the United States drives us into a corner.”",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"North Korea has previously implied that it would transfer nuclear weapons to other countries, but Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research (INR) Thomas Fingar told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in February that “[t]here is no convincing evidence that [North Korea] has ever sold, given, or even offered to transfer such material to any state or nonstate actor.”",1,14

Pyongyang plans to reprocess the spent fuel to produce additional nuclear weapons, Han added.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"South Korea has verified the reactor shutdown “through various channels,” Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry official Kim Sook told the Korean Broadcasting System the same day.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Whether Pyongyang is in the process of producing additional plutonium is unclear.,1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Stopping the reactor’s operation is necessary if North Korea is to unload the reactor’s irradiated nuclear fuel rods. Spent nuclear fuel can be “reprocessed” to separate plutonium from other elements of those fuel rods, which can then be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Despite Han’s boast, other observers are not certain that Pyongyang intends either to unload or reprocess the fuel rods.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"South Korea’s semi-official Yonhap News Agency quoted an unnamed South Korean “senior government official” April 18 who contended that North Korea suspended the reactor merely for “technical reasons.” That official cautioned that this assessment could change, the report said.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,The U.S. assessment that North Korea has one or two weapons is believed to have been based on estimates of the amount of plutonium North Korea separated from spent fuel produced in the reactor prior to a 1994 agreement with the United States. Whether Pyongyang has since built weapons is unclear.,1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"North Korea announced in December 2002 that it was restarting the reactor, which, along with North Korea’s reprocessing facility and approximately 8,000 spent fuel rods, had been frozen under the 1994 agreement. Later that month, North Korea ejected International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors charged with monitoring the freeze. The United States announced in February 2003 that North Korea had restarted the reactor.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Pyongyang’s announcement followed the escalation of bilateral diplomatic tensions after the October 2002 meeting with the U.S. delegation.,1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Pyongyang has since claimed to have reprocessed the spent fuel previously subject to IAEA monitoring. That fuel would have contained enough plutonium for “several more” nuclear weapons, then-CIA director George Tenet told the Senate Intelligence Committee in February 2004.",1,14
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,North Korea’s possible reprocessing likely formed the basis for current CIA director Porter Goss’s February 2005 statement before the same committee that Pyongyang’s “capability” to produce nuclear weapons has “increased.”,1,14

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Describing another possible danger of North Korea’s unfettered nuclear program, a 2003 INR assessment indicates that North Korea is more apt to export nuclear material as it produces more plutonium.
