html body text dl dd span  ,"While speeding up heart rate increases output, it also raises pressure",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,", making symptoms worse. In a healthy person, raising heart rate does not change pressures",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,much because the ventricle is able to relax faster as heart rate speeds up.,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"However, in DHF patients, the response to increased heart rate is not normal. When heart rate speeds up, the ventricle cannot relax any faster. This raises pressures",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,". By slowing heart rate, you give the ventricle more time to relax, lowering filling pressures. Also, many DHF patients have ischemia. By slowing the heart rate, you reduce the heart's need for oxygen and that helps balance supply and demand of blood and oxygen",1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Question,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"Seeing that pretty much the same drugs are used to treat both diastolic are systolic heart failure, how important is it to tell DHF from SHF?",1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Dr. Zile,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"There are at least 40 well-done trials to guide treatment for systolic heart failure patients. This is not true for DHF, so its treatment is less certain.",1,6
html body text dl dd span span  ,"Even though we say ACE inhibitors will probably help and ARBs may help, and beta-blockers may help, and so on, it is not proven in large numbers of DHF patients.",1,7
html body text dl dd span  ,"Also, there are differences in the way you use those drugs and in the doses you use.",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"The best example is beta-blockers. Treating heart failure in patients with an EF of 30% requires that beta-blocker dose be raised carefully, starting with tiny doses and raising it slowly over several months. In the DHF patient, that very slow rise in dose is not usually necessary.",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"Another example is calcium channel blockers. These drugs should not be used in systolic heart failure patients at all, but they may help DHF patients. As another example, diuretic use needs to be much more cautious in the DHF patient since drying them out too much can easily cause too-low blood pressure.",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"So even though the same drugs may be used to treat SHF and DHF, there are important differences. It is important for doctors to be aware of the differences when treating CHF patients",1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Question,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,Have beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers been shown to reverse measurements of diastolic dysfunction?,1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Dr. Zile,1,6
html body text dl dd span span  ,"If you give beta-blockers to DHF patients, their relaxation rate gets worse instead of better. Despite this, patients feel better -",1,7
html body text dl dd span span  ,so measurements don't always agree with how patients actually do while taking a drug.,1,7
html body text dl dd span span  ,"With calcium channel blockers, DHF patients feel better while taking them",1,7
html body text dl dd span i span  ,and,1,8
html body text dl dd span span  ,their filling rates usually get better. There is a complex relationship between how any one drug affects a person versus how that drug affects the measurements we take of that person's heart function.,1,7
html body text dl dd span  ,"One study that used a calcium channel blocker and another study using an ARB showed improved exercise times in patients taking these drugs. However, neither study showed improved measurements of heart relaxation or stiffness. I don't think you can rely just on measures of heart function to guide treatment.",1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Question,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"In making a DHF diagnosis, what must be ruled out besides systolic heart failure?",1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Dr. Zile,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"Besides excluding SHF, it is also important to rule out mitral valve stenosis and chronic lung disease, both of which can imitate heart failure with a normal EF",1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Question,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,What blood pressure drugs are most likely to help heart enlargement in DHF patients?,1,6
html body text dl dt span  ,Dr. Zile,1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"Although it hasn't been clearly proven yet, I think drugs that alter the neurohormonal systems work well. They not only lower pressure, but they also reduce the effects of overactive bodily systems. The problem is that in most trials, heart enlargement only goes down about 10 to 15%. This will probably improve heart function but not totally reverse DHF. If those high blood pressure trials had been longer by 5 or 10 years, we might have seen more improvement proven down the road.",1,6
html body text dl dd span  ,"What evidence do I have to support that? The answer comes from patients with aortic stenosis who had their aortic valves replaced. Three to 5 years after aortic valve replacement, ventricular size and stiffness often returned to normal, improving the heart's stiffness and relaxation",1,6
