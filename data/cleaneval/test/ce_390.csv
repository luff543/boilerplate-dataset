html body text p span  ,Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered world),1,5
html body text p span  ,and how (to what extent) he overcame them.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a,1,5
html body text p span  ,Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which destroyed",1,5
html body text p span  ,his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a,1,5
html body text p span  ,bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z,1,5
html body text p span  ,"suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak,",1,5
html body text p span  ,read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes,1,5
html body text p span  ,"how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand the",1,5
html body text p span  ,"way to speak, read and write.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision",1,5
html body text p span  ,worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single,1,5
html body text p span  ,"object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side",1,5
html body text p span  ,of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon,1,5
html body text p span  ,he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or,1,5
html body text p span  ,mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see,1,5
html body text p span  ,would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside,1,5
html body text p span  ,"down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much",1,5
html body text p span  ,as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were,1,5
html body text p span  ,imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged,1,5
html body text p span  ,area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual,1,5
html body text p span  ,memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist.,1,5
html body text p span  ,He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls,1,5
html body text p span  ,as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his,1,5
html body text p span  ,"reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other objects",1,5
html body text p span  ,around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he,1,5
html body text p span  ,can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware,1,5
html body text p span  ,of the positioning of his body's parts.,1,5
html body text p span  ,If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was.,1,5
html body text p span  ,He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back,1,5
html body text p span  ,was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his,1,5
html body text p span  ,body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible,1,5
html body text p span  ,for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For,1,5
html body text p span  ,"example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all",1,5
html body text p span  ,bewildered.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going to,1,5
html body text p span  ,the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time,1,5
html body text p span  ,when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because,1,5
html body text p span  ,he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains,1,5
html body text p span  ,were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no",1,5
html body text p span  ,sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He,1,5
html body text p span  ,perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example,1,5
html body text p span  ,if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was,1,5
html body text p span  ,and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands;,1,5
html body text p span  ,he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed,1,5
html body text p span  ,to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how,1,5
html body text p span  ,to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital,1,5
html body text p span  ,workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them.,1,5
html body text p span  ,They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More,1,5
html body text p span  ,misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example,1,5
html body text p span  ,when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his,1,5
html body text p span  ,foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to,1,5
html body text p span  ,reach out and touch things in his room.,1,5
html body text p span  ,He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest,1,5
html body text p span  ,things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria,1,5
html body text p span  ,"describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a blindfolded",1,5
html body text p span  ,man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him,1,5
html body text p span  ,"because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or",1,5
html body text p span  ,right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't,1,5
html body text p span  ,even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial,1,5
html body text p span  ,orientation.,1,5
html body text p span  ,His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him,1,5
html body text p span  ,"hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family",1,5
html body text p span  ,bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the,1,5
html body text p span  ,instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was,1,5
html body text p span  ,faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when,1,5
html body text p span  ,"he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't",1,5
html body text p span  ,"remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill.",1,5
html body text p span  ,By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not,1,5
html body text p span  ,immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very,1,5
html body text p span  ,"difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to",1,5
html body text p span  ,associate words with them but he could only remember these for a couple,1,5
html body text p span  ,"of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the",1,5
html body text p span  ,out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few,1,5
html body text p span  ,months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall,1,5
html body text p span  ,it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered,1,5
html body text p span  ,"subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each",1,5
html body text p span  ,letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right,1,5
html body text p span  ,and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at,1,5
html body text p span  ,a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of,1,5
html body text p span  ,a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a,1,5
html body text p span  ,"result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact",1,5
html body text p span  ,that he couldn't read out of his right eye.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find,1,5
html body text p span  ,out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used,1,5
html body text p span  ,this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually,1,5
html body text p span  ,holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to,1,5
html body text p span  ,do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he,1,5
html body text p span  ,wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read, that",1,5
html body text p span  ,being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive,1,5
html body text p span  ,practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he,1,5
html body text p span  ,wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any,1,5
html body text p span  ,kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The,1,5
html body text p span  ,injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with,1,5
html body text p span  ,language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a,1,5
html body text p span  ,patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words,1,5
html body text p span  ,"and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what",1,5
html body text p span  ,`brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what,1,5
html body text p span  ,`brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short,1,5
html body text p span  ,sentences.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years,1,5
html body text p span  ,writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or,1,5
html body text p span  ,one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He,1,5
html body text p span  ,didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently,1,5
html body text p span  ,wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his,1,5
html body text p span  ,ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every,1,5
html body text p span  ,word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing,1,5
html body text p span  ,about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what,1,5
html body text p span  ,"he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he",1,5
html body text p span  ,"no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on",1,5
html body text p span  ,"writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer towards",1,5
html body text p span  ,the end of his journal.,1,5
html body text p span  ,All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of,1,5
html body text p span  ,"memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even",1,5
html body text p span  ,remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be,1,5
html body text p span  ,"lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue.",1,5
html body text p span  ,If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely,1,5
html body text p span  ,difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be,1,5
html body text p span  ,"thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example,",1,5
html body text p span  ,"familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory",1,5
html body text p span  ,was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the,1,5
html body text p span  ,rest of his world.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying",1,5
html body text p span  ,anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him,1,5
html body text p span  ,in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and,1,5
html body text p span  ,remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He,1,5
html body text p span  ,was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as,1,5
html body text p span  ,"a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some",1,5
html body text p span  ,coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd forget,1,5
html body text p span  ,why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things he,1,5
html body text p span  ,could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember,1,5
html body text p span  ,things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The,1,5
html body text p span  ,funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he,1,5
html body text p span  ,"stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent",1,5
html body text p span  ,situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories,1,5
html body text p span  ,with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as,1,5
html body text p span  ,remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He,1,5
html body text p span  ,couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately,1,5
html body text p span  ,recognised them.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been",1,5
html body text p span  ,pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd,1,5
html body text p span  ,learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well,1,5
html body text p span  ,as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count",1,5
html body text p span  ,back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you,1,5
html body text p span  ,"or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in",1,5
html body text p span  ,a way that a young child would.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his",1,5
html body text p span  ,wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral,1,5
html body text p span  ,cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made,1,5
html body text p span  ,although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still annoy,1,5
html body text p span  ,"him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space'",1,5
html body text p span  ,continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home,1,5
html body text p span  ,settlement.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how",1,5
html body text p span  ,"to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you",1,5
html body text p span  ,know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at the,1,5
html body text p span  ,most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort,1,5
html body text p span  ,"to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved.",1,5
html body text p span  ,But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered,1,5
html body text p span  ,his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really,1,5
html body text p span  ,overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to,1,5
html body text p span  ,improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life,1,5
html body text p span  ,which had no real end.,1,5
