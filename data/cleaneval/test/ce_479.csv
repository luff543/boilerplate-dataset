html body text p span  ,Announcements: ASTM is making virtual meeting technology available to members. An Internet connection is required. A sub group of the subcommittees could meet via Internet to make presentations or make progress on task group work in between regular meetings. Call Jim Olshefsky (Staff Manager) to get more info on how to set up a virtual meeting.,1,5
html body text p span  ,1) Introductions were made of those in attendance.,1,5
html body text p span  ,2) Changes in agenda - Pole Vaulting & Martial Arts were moved up in the agenda.,1,5
html body text p span  ,3) F-1446-00 Base Standard -,1,5
html body text p span  ,a) Headform specification: - David Spenciner - We currently reference a draft international standard (ISO 6220) that has been discontinued in our helmet tests. Intention is to take the information from this document and put it in ASTM format than we would have our own headform standard. The document was balloted and there were 3 comments and 1 negative.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Negative: Dave Thom - Frankfort plane vs. Basic plane. No evidence that the Basic plane corresponds to Frankfort plane. EN960 is referenced in this document but Frankfort plane is not mentioned in EN960. If there is a reference that ties these two planes together, then it should be listed in the headform draft. If not, then the term ""Frankfort plane"" should be taken out. It was determined that this wording can be removed as an editorial change.",1,5
html body text p span  ,Motion: Made by Dean Fisher: Term was found to be editorial and the term Frankfort plane will be removed.,1,5
html body text p span  ,Vote:,1,5
html body text p span  ,Yes --- Passed unanimously,1,5
html body text p span  ,No ---,1,5
html body text p span  ,Abstain ---,1,5
html body text p span  ,Additional comments:,1,5
html body text p span  ,"1) Comment from Dave Thom - Product marking discussion - Product marking vs. just ""marking""",1,5
html body text p span  ,"2) Comment from Jason Brand & Dave Thom - 4 typos in document. 2 pages of text and 5 pages of tables. The numbers (typos) in the tables will be changed to reflect what is currently in the ISO draft standard. Dave Spenciner commented that in moving forward, there should be some review of these numbers at a later date. These would not be editorial changes.",1,5
html body text p span  ,3) Comment from Jacques Tholin deals with the possibility of the headform rotating on impact. Energy used in rotation is not captured by linear accelerometer. This was discussed yesterday at shirtsleeves meeting. Will wait for Jacques Tholin to come to next meeting for further explanation and discussion.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"4) Comment from Guillaume Bélanger - (Section 4) Suggests that all headform sizes should be included from A-Q as per EN960 instead of only the 5 sizes (A, E, J, M & O). After extended discussion it was concluded that this topic along with the shape geometry will be discussed as part of the next revision, since this document has passed main committee.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"5) Comment from Guillaume Bélanger - Delete the word ""helmet"" from the headform standard. (editorial change).",1,5
html body text p span  ,"6) Comment from Celia Peterson - Cross reference to ANSI headform C which is a part of ASTM F355 (playground equipment) (similar to DOT standard). - There is another reference that they can use, original ANSI standard or DOT standard.",1,5
html body text p span  ,Congratulations were given to Dave Spenciner for completing this standard. Dave will get with ASTM editorial staff regarding small changes. The document then moves on to publication. Dave will then start work on possible revisions to the published document based on comments provided at this last ballot.,1,5
html body text p span  ,b) Comprehensive Clean-up - Dan Pomerening - Dan was absent from this meeting due to family reasons - Dan continues to look at this subcommittee's various standards to make them more uniform in format.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"c) Labeling - Jason Brand - Jason had put together a spreadsheet of all labeling from each of the standards of this subcommittee plus two from Ice Hockey subcommittee. Some revisions were made after the Pittsburgh meeting and copies were sent to the labeling task group. More assistance is needed. The plan is to specifically look at F1446, revise, look for commonalties and then suggest labeling for "" use only for ..."" and multiple standards. After F1446, will go through remaining standards and revise as needed. Keep in mind label requirements for CPSC and CSA.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"Note: If anyone would like to be on the e-mail list of the labeling task group, please contact Jason Brand (jason@teamwendy.com)",1,5
html body text p span  ,"d) Dynamic Strap Test (F1446) - Roy Burek - Ballot item - Purpose of suggested change dealt with instructing technicians on how to adjust the harness when testing to remove variability. 1 negative and 2 comments. Negative - Dave Spenciner - The proposed change was not clear. Needs clarification to add an extra step. Wording changes - should be appropriate ""referenced"" headform. An additional wording change regarding ""impact headform"". Will confirm with ASTM to make sure these changes are editorial. The changes will be made and the negative was withdrawn.Comments - Additional comments were discussed from Dennis Piper, Jason Brand and Jeff Skein.",1,5
html body text p span  ,Additional activity (F1446) - Dave Spenciner has offered to help with the P&B task force. We have some data from CPSC's round robin several years ago that may work without further testing for the Precision and Bias statement,1,5

html body text p span  ,No activity. Dr. Hank Cross was not at the meeting. Nothing pending.,1,5

html body text p span  ,"6) Martial Arts Helmet - Dr. Dennis Lieu - The task group met yesterday with approx. 12 people at the meeting. The draft specification was covered in detail. Copies are available from Dr. Lieu. Progress has been good, and there has been good cooperation. The draft martial arts specification came from already existing ASTM test methods and some of the work from Dr. Lieu's laboratory. The draft currently calls for 2 types of tests.",1,5
html body text ul p span  ,"a) Falling test, standard ASTM test, low & high energy levels",1,6
html body text ul p span  ,"b) Impact test , swinging arm which simulates types of impact in martial arts. low & high energy.",1,6
html body text span  ,This is not a one time use head gear. Needs to survive multiple impacts over an extended period of time. A Hybrid III head was proposed. The impact tester for the swing arm needs to be built. Low temperature test was eliminated. Test line - area of testing was expanded where impacts are expected. Eliminate max. mass specification. Headgear must protect the wearer and opponent (striker). Labeling will have to be reviewed. Discussed life span recommendation. It was noted that there is a European martial arts standard.,1,4
