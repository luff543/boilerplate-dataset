html body text div h2 span  ,Change the Media. Become the Media. Reclaim the Media: Come to the Bellingham Grassroots & Independent Media Conference.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"On March 24th, veteran TV talkshow host, Phil Donahue, now banished from MSNBC for airing the views of millions of Americans who opposed the Iraq invasion, told Democracy Nowâ€™s Amy Goodman: â€œWe have an emergency in the media, and we have to fix it.â€? This sentiment resonates with the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans and citizens around the world who are standing up to challenge the growing power of the giant media corporations. Everyday these corporations shirk more of the public interest, slash more of their news budgets, and fail to deliver information vital to the health of our communities and our democracy.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"The movement to challenge these giant corporations is much more than a media reform movement, it is a grassroots media production movement: a movement of independent journalists, radio producers, filmmakers, and online community builders, a movement of storytellers constantly seeking better ways to make and distribute the stories the big corporations canâ€™t or wonâ€™t produce for our communities. This is a movement for everyone that likes a good story, that wants to tell one or hear one, whether theyâ€™re a veteran media-maker or someone whose only just thought of picking up a camera or imagined seeing their story in print. This is a movement that believes the more we democratize the media by growing the pool of storytellers and distributing their stories, the better off our communities, and our democracy will be.",1,6

html body text div h2 span  ,Tip Credit is Tip Theft! Rep. Kelli Linville wants to pass bill to legalize restaurant lobby theft of worker's tips,1,6
html body text div div span  ,Rep. Kelli Linville is also sponsoring HB 1795 the Restaurant Workers Wage and Benefit Protection and Enhancement Act (The version in the Senate is SB 5774). The title is totally misleading. At a meeting with local Dems Saturday she basically refused to say why she supported it. If passed this bill will effectively destroy a whole sector of living wage jobs in this state!,1,6
html body text div div span  ,What the bills do:,1,6
html body text div div span  ,Restaurant owners are pursuing legislation in Olympia that would cut tipped employees minimum wage from $7.35 per hour to a base wage of $3.68 per hour.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Instead of â€œprotectingâ€? or â€œenhancingâ€? workers wages and benefits this legislation would basically cut all tipped employees minimum wages to $3.68 instead of the current state minimum wage of $7.35. Restaurant Employers would be required to make up the difference only if tips did not. So if a server was receiving the minimum wage whatever a server made between $7.35 and $11.03 every hour would go into the employers pocket. Thatâ€™s is basically a wage cut of $3.68 per hour, nearly $30 in an 8 hr. day, and nearly $150 a week. Thatâ€™s taking a living wage job and turning it into a poverty level job.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Plus, how long would an employee who didn't make an average of $3.70 an hour in tips last before their boss fired them?",1,6
html body text div div span  ,Another thing about this legislation is that it only applies to new hires. This is a shameless dirty trick to make restaurant employees relax into thinking this won't effect them.,1,6

html body text div h2 span  ,"Water Bill Amended, Public Interest Still Trampled",1,6
html body text div div span  ,Having spoken with the Sierra Clubâ€™s Olympia lobbyist Friday I understand that some amendments have been made in the Senate version SB 5285 (house version is HB 1357) which would facilitate the privatization of municipal water provision in Washington.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,SB 5285 did escape from committee.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,Rep. Kelli Linville vowed to kill the house bill in her committee Saturday at a meeting in Bellingham:,1,6
html body text div div span  ,According to the Cascade Sierra Clubâ€™s website:,1,6
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"â€?Provisions that would have allowed private ownership of public water systems were removed. Now, the bill provides a process for local governments to contract with private companies to design, build, and operate public water systems. Other improvements include limits on the length of the contracts, and language that ensure water rights don't transfer from the local government to the private company.â€?",1,7
html body text div div span  ,"However I feel that the bill is still deeply flawed and should be scrapped altogether. The bill still halves from 60 to 30 days the requirement for public notice. The bill still deletes the existing requirement obligating service providers to demonstrate that a local governmentâ€™s annual costs will be lower under its proposal than they would be if the local government itself financed, constructed, owned, operated, and maintained facilities. Instead local official will merely determine that privatization of services is in the â€œpublic interest.â€?",1,6
html body text div div span  ,There is no reason to cut the time for public process in half. There is no reason not to require service providers to demonstrate the financial benefits of privatization. According to Hugh Jackson of Public Citizen even the Federal government requires the potential service providers demonstrate a 10% savings before services are privatized.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Apparently some local elected officials such as those in Sunnyside, Washington are so ready to privatize their services do not even want to know if privatization is a cheaper alternative. Rep. Linville says the City of Bellingham sent her the bill.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,I think our elected officials in Olympia have an obligation to protect Washington residents from being gouged by private water companies and from having their municipalities budgetâ€™s raided by these same companies no matter where they live and no matter how irresponsible their local elected officials wish to be.,1,6

html body text div div span  ,While in Olympia for environmental lobby day Thursday I found out about Senate Bill 5285 and House Bill 1357. These bills would make it easier to privatize municipal water provision in Washington state. I have since found out that Sen. Adam Kline and Rep.

html body text div div span  ,"To whom it may concern,",1,6
html body text div div span  ,Your radio feature by Kirsten Kendrick on social security aired on February 11th appears to lack basis in fact. In the feature Ms. Kendrick interviews a local financial consultant on the subject of what people will need to know when they get a chance to manage their money under President Bush's plan to divert money from social security into private accounts.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Where is the evidence people will get to manage their own money under the Bush plan? Is Ms. Kendrick's report based solely on the President Bush's remarks in the State of the Union address? President Bush has not released a detailed plan and as of Tuesday, February 8th the White House said they had no plans to: see this story for details",1,6
html body text div div span  ,http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=politicsNews&storyID=7574181,0,6
html body text div div span  ,"Given this lack of a plan all reporting about so-called personal accounts is based on supposition. Without acknowledging this fact Ms. Kendrick's story both assumes and helps spread the misinformation that people will have a chance to make their own decisions over what to do with the money from their ""personal accounts"". There is no evidence that the so-called ""personal accounts"" will have any resemblance to what is generally considered personal ownership. Ms. Kendrick's feature blithely ignores this fact.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,MSNBC's Martin Wolk on February 4th reported,1,6
html body text div div span  ,(http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6914807/) wrote that:,0,6
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"""President Bush frequently argues that one of the big advantages of his proposed personal retirement accounts is that unlike traditional Social Security they would allow participants to leave any accumulated wealth to their â€œchildren or grandchildren.â€?",1,7

html body text div div blockquote span  ,"and that: ""According to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the still-sketchy proposal this week, many workers who elect to participate in the personal account program would be required at retirement age to purchase an annuity to ensure they have a minimal stream of annual income for the rest of their life.""",1,7
html body text div div span  ,"Mr Wolk minces word by saying that the assumptions promoted the President and repeated by Ms. Kendricks are ""not completely true."" They are intentionally misleading. To be blunt they are lies promoted by the White House to help sell their plan. There are many ways to approach this story and many ways to distort it. I encourage KPLU and Ms. Kendricks to investigate these issue more thorougly before reporting.

html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Please repeat after me: war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, Bush wants to save social security.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,â€œBush: Save Social Securityâ€? was the post State of the Union headline in the Feb 4th Bellingham Herald. This headline no doubt produced a state of confusion in many who read it. In what sense does President Bush want to â€˜save social securityâ€™? Perhaps only in the sense of that officer in Vietnam who said: â€œWe had to destroy the village in order save it.â€?,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"So why is the major media working so hard for Mr. Bush? Itâ€™s a good question, and maybe the question. Democrats have been doing a good job of holding their elected officials accountable, but itâ€™s time to start working on the press. The battle to save social security has in many ways already been won in Washington, D.C. but if we do nothing it may be lost in newsrooms around the country. Hereâ€™s another key question: When the President tells a lie is it the duty of the press to repeat the lie verbatim? Or is it the duty of the press to call the President out for lying? When we fail to answer this question correctly we go to war on false pretenses, gut key social programs, and bankrupt the nation.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"In 1946 George Orwell published his famous essay â€œPolitics and the English Languageâ€? in which he wrote: â€œA man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks.

It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.â€? The times being what they are we cannot afford foolish thoughts or a slovenly media which fails to hold the powerful accountable to the truth.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Diverting money from the social security trust fund into private accounts will not save and strengthen social security, it will only weaken and defund it. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research nearly 2/3rds of elderly households get more than half their income from social security and nearly half of the elderly would fall below the poverty line without it. Additionally, more than 6 million workers receive disability benefits through the Social Security trust fund, as do 1.6 million children.

html body text div div span  ,From the desk Senator Patty Murray:,1,6
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"A few short years after the 1932 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression, one of our nation's greatest leaders â€“ Franklin Delano Roosevelt â€“ set out to create a program to provide peace of mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During his crusade to create the program, FDR said, ""There is no tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support.""",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"The program he created is to this day the single greatest social insurance program in our nation's history. Social Security, as it would be called, has been a resounding success by keeping millions of people out of poverty.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Just months before the new program was enacted, FDR laid out his vision of how this most important program should be implemented.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"He said: ""We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population against one-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life. But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too, represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but is by no means complete.... It is...a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness."" Those were the words of FDR in August, 1935",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"But today, this cornerstone, this basic American value, is now under attack.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,President Bush is currently traveling the country saying Social Security is in crisis and that it needs to be radically restructured. But I rise today to reaffirm the values and spirit FDR laid out 70 years ago.,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,Social Security has pulled seniors from poverty and put millions of retiring minds at ease. America's insurance program is a guaranteed benefit that all Americans can count on.,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"It's a promise that if you work hard, you'll have some security when you retire or if you become disabled. It's a promise that seniors won't have to live in poverty. And it's a promise that if your spouse passes on, you will continue to have the support and security you need.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"And of course the program is about more than security -- it's about community. In America, we believe that it's important to take care of the generation that came before. It's important to guarantee them a quality of life. And it's important that we guarantee benefits after a lifetime of hard work.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"But I'm very concerned that President Bush's ""restructuring"" will imperil the security of all Americans â€“ from young workers retiring in decades to seniors retiring today. The problem with his plan is that:",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* It's the end of guaranteed benefits.,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* It does nothing to fix the long-term issues the system faces.,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* It adds trillions of dollars to our national debt.,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* It's dangerous.,1,7

html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them, and if I see something that's going to hurt our workers, our families, and our seniors, I'm going to fight it with everything I've got.",1,7

html body text div div blockquote span  ,We must:,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* Preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefit,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* Preserve Social Security's protections for workers when they are disabled,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"* Protect against benefit reductions for women, minorities and all others",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,* Protect our budget from ever growing deficits,1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Anything short of this would be an unnecessary, dangerous gamble unworthy of this important insurance program.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"While weâ€™re just beginning this discussion, my female colleagues and I have worked for years to ensure some basic principles are followed as we move forward. The promise of Social Security is especially important to women because women face unique challenges in retirement. We know that women make less money than men, women leave the workforce to raise families, women live longer, and women are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Even with those special challenges, Social Security keeps millions of older women out of poverty. Its benefit formulas are tilted to give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and minorities. If the President privatizes Social Security, he would destroy the guaranteed benefit that low-wage earners need in their retirement years.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"We also know that Social Security isn't just a retirement program. As I've said, it protects disabled workers and their families. If Social Security is privatized, what happens to a worker who is disabled and can't contribute to her account? Today, under Social Security, that worker is protected. But there's no guarantee under the Bush plan.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"President Bush could undo the progressive structure that older women depend on. This is one reform that would have disastrous results, and I know we will not stand for it.",1,7
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"Under this Administration, many things we take for granted from overtime pay to community police to safe drinking water have been threatened. Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security. I am here today to say that some things are just too important to American families.

Instead, Plan 2 from the Presidentâ€™s Social Security Commission, upon which the White House is shaping its proposal, would only offer workers a very limited choice of index funds, into which the government would place their money. Also, the Presidentâ€™s plan would not allow workers to draw down money from their accounts prior to retirement.""",1,6
