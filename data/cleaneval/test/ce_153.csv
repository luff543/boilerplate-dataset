For us at CERN it all started 30 yearsago when one of the first electronic digital computers, a hugeFerranti Mercury, was installed. It was the beginning of a successstory which has changed the way to do physics and, as a matter offact, to do any work at all in the Laboratory.",1,10

Those who witnessed the beginning of the information era wereconscious of the potential impact of those mar marvellous machineson Physics as well as on Society, but they could hardly imaginewhat was to come. In retrospect, we can say that the 30 years whichseparate us from the days of those first generation machines, havebeen years of struggle, of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and ofpainful reappraisal, but also years of discovery, of excitement, ofachievement and of pride to the actors in this uniqueadventure.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td artbody p span  ,"The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury weretechnical, political and financial. Technically the Mercury wasdefinitely one of the most advanced machines around. It wasconsidered superior to the Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, tothe English Electric 'Deuce', to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and todrum-type machines like the IBM 650. Ferranti was set up to producea dozen units and CERN was going to get serial number 6. The factthat Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's was given a certainweight. CERN had no experience in electronic digital computers andit was better to be part of a club of users. As to the price (onemillion Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than equivalentAmerican machines like the ERA 1101.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td artbody p span  ,"Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and 1956.External experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad Zuse'srelay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general purposecomputer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years afterMaurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues ofbinary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating pointarithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the EDSAC32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10 digitswords. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n forthe ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input andoutput data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or cards).Practical problems had to do with the unreliability of thehardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment ofexperts. Obsolescence was already a problem.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td artbody p span  ,"CERN decided that the machine should be purely binary, that32-bit words were too short, and that the speed should be as highas possible (in particular multiplication time should be under amillisecond).

It was a significant advance inthat it allowed as many as six peripheral devices to access corememory buffers while the CPU performed other work. Anotherimportant device which came with the 709 was the so-called DirectData Connection, allowing for direct transmission of data fromexternal equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was notridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was alsoequipped with one of the first",1,10

The on-line card reader and the printer did, however,slow down the operations considerably. After one year of experienceCERN added a small IBM 1401, in order to speed up the input/output,the job sequencing and the operations. The concept of SPOOLing(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line) with its 1/0 files(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in those days.

It is amusing to notethat, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic developmentof codes, the machines were normally switched off at weekends. Butthe practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was around thecorner.

Basic SIPROS operating system had to be made at CERN. ThenChippewa OS (COS) was installed. It evolved to SCOPE which waseventually used after adapting it to CERN needs. This resulted in anon-trivial amount of changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERNSCOPE. The 6600 was connected to various FSD systems and to twoon-line computers, the SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made datalinks.

During this long period ofstruggling with hardware instabilities and software development andchanges, computing work was done partly by sending jobs to outsidecomputers and partly by processing data on a CDC 3400, and later ona 3800, temporarily made available at CERN by Control Data.",1,10

This machine was eventually acquired bythe State of Geneva and installed at the local University. At CERNit was replaced by a CDC 6400. It is worth noting that CERNacquired other machines of the 3000 s series, e.g. a 3100 for theFOCUS project offering semi-interactive facilities and quicksampling of experimental data at the central computers, and a 3200for interactive graphics applications.",1,10
