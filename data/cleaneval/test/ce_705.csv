html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Why do the coal and nuclear industries love hydrogen?,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"All of a sudden, hydrogen is the hottest atom on the periodic table. When compressed into fuel cells, the element works like a battery that can power everything from cars to spaceships, while producing no waste—just drinkable water. Alternative-energy guru Amory Lovins is a fan, as is National Mining Association president Jack Gerard. Other enthusiasts are politicians looking to establish green credentials without irritating the automotive and energy lobbies.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"First on the bandwagon was President George W. Bush, who announced last year that his administration is investing $1.7 billion over five years to develop hydrogen fuel-cell technology for automobiles. Then California’s newly elected governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, vowed to sign an executive order requiring hydrogen fueling stations every 20 miles on the state’s highways. Schwarzenegger, who popularized the gas-guzzling military Humvee as a trophy car for civilians, has said he will convert one of his five Hummers to run on hydrogen, a $35,000 upgrade.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Schwarzenegger’s hydrogen fueling stations would cost up to half a million dollars each, which seems a bit pricey when you consider that his converted Hummer will be about the only vehicle using them. There are no hydrogen-powered cars in the showrooms now, and Bush’s fuel-cell program doesn’t give auto manufacturers any deadlines for producing one. The few prototypes on the road cost several million dollars, and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences said that fuel-cell cars are still decades away.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"There’s also the small matter of producing the hydrogen, which doesn’t occur in its pure form on Earth. One option is to split hydrogen from water using electricity, but unless the electricity comes from a renewable source like wind or solar, this method could end up increasing greenhouse-gas emissions. The Bush administration, ever eager to prop up the coal, oil, and nuclear industries, advocates extracting hydrogen from fossil fuels and splitting it from water using nuclear power. Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club’s Global Warming and Energy Program, characterizes this approach as ""a nicotine patch that causes cancer.""",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Department of Energy estimates that Bush’s hydrogen fuel-cell initiatives could reduce demand for petroleum by 11 million barrels per day by 2040. But making gas-powered cars even slightly more efficient would achieve huge savings a whole lot sooner. If U.S. cars averaged a very achievable 40 miles a gallon, we could cut oil consumption by 4 million barrels per day right now—nearly as much as the United States imports from OPEC. —",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol on global warming in 2002, and estimates are that it will have to raise energy prices by as much as 60 to 70 percent in order to comply. The London-based New Economics Foundation argues that because the United States won’t be faced with similar costs, U.S. businesses enjoy an unfair competitive advantage. To level the economic playing field, the foundation suggests slapping a duty on imports from nations that refuse to ratify the protocol. Such ""remedial trade restrictions"" have been allowed by the World Trade Organization before, and might just make willful disregard for our warming world too hot to handle.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Rivers commonly serve as political divides, but in the Middle East, where armed conflict is a fact of life, environmental concerns over a beleaguered stream have brought people together. Since the mid-1990s, Israeli and Palestinian scientists have been working together to clean up the Alexander River, which carries sewage from two Palestinian towns into Israel’s coastal plain north of Tel Aviv and on to the Mediterranean.

Instead of making a buck, the company opted to work with U.S. and Chilean environmental organizations to create a nature preserve.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Motor Trend magazine’s 2004 Car of the Year is so much in demand that you may have to wait up to four months if you want to own one. But this coveted vehicle isn’t a hot new roadster. It’s the Toyota Prius, a gas-electric hybrid whose raciest spec is that it gets 60 miles per gallon in city driving. Interest is so high that Toyota is increasing Prius production by 25 percent, and is scurrying to introduce additional hybrid models, including a luxury Lexus.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Toyota’s competitors have taken notice. Honda will introduce a hybrid version of its top-selling midsize Accord this fall, complementing its gas-electric Civic sedan and two-seater Insight models. Next year, Ford will offer a gas-electric version of its compact Escape sport-utility vehicle, which is expected to get up to 40 mpg. ""Fuel-efficient hybrid gasoline-electric cars and trucks are pulling out of the Sierra Club parking lot and into a driveway near you,"" writes the Detroit Free Press.",1,13

And Subaru is one automaker that seems to be driving the wrong way. Long a preferred choice of outdoorsy auto buyers who want all-wheel drive but not inefficient SUVs, Subaru recently announced that its popular Outback models would gain an inch or so in height, thereby qualifying as ""light trucks."" The switch allows the company to take advantage of a loophole in federal fuel-economy standards that lets trucks enjoy a lower mpg standard than cars.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p a span  ,Lax mercury rules threaten rich as well as poor,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Many environmental hazards seem perversely aimed at the poor. People in older houses with peeling paint are susceptible to lead poisoning; subsistence fishers pull PCB-laden fish out of industrial waterways. But a recent study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives shows that middle- and upper-income women who eat large amounts of tuna and swordfish steaks are contaminated with mercury at rates up to ten times that of the population at large.,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"It’s not only ahi-eating Atkins dieters who are at risk, though. Another new study, this one by the EPA, shows that one in every six women of childbearing age—twice as many as previously thought—now has potentially harmful amounts of mercury in her bloodstream, and that 630,000 children are born each year with blood mercury above the EPA’s safe level. A potent neurotoxin that is especially hazardous to developing fetuses and young children, mercury can impair intelligence and learning ability, and even lead to permanent brain damage.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"How is such widespread poisoning taking place? No one knows for sure, but a likely culprit is canned tuna, the most widely eaten fish in the United States. (Children consume twice as much canned tuna as any other fish.) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rarely tests canned tuna at all, but nongovernmental groups have found shockingly high mercury levels, particularly in albacore, aka ""white"" tuna. A 44-pound child eating one six-ounce can of albacore per week would exceed the EPA’s safety standard by four times; a 132-pound woman by one and a half times. This March, the EPA and the FDA issued a strict new advisory, warning pregnant women, nursing mothers, women who may become pregnant, and young children not to eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish at all; to limit albacore to one meal per week; and closely watch local advisories about wild-caught fish.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Simultaneously, however, the EPA was facilitating the continued dumping of large amounts of mercury into the atmosphere from coal-fired power plants. Until recently, these plants were expected to reduce their emissions by 90 percent within three years. But last December, at the power industry’s urging, the EPA proposed instead establishing a system of pollution permits that could be bought and sold between companies, but would take six years to achieve a 30 percent reduction. EPA staffers complained that they were told not to perform the usual scientific and economic analysis of the new proposal, portions of which were identical to recommendations from a utility-industry lobbying firm.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Last November, agricultural economist Dr. Charles Benbrook published the first long-term study of pesticide use on corn, soybeans, and cotton genetically engineered to tolerate herbicides or to produce their own insecticides. Relying on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he found that pesticide application indeed declined during the first three years of commercial use—just as industry claimed it would. But in the last three years of the eight-year study period, pesticide use on genetically modified soybeans, the most common bioengineered crop, skyrocketed. Biotech cotton and corn registered small increases as well. Overall, pesticide use rose by 50 million pounds.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The change, Benbrook says, is no surprise.
