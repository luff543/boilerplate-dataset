html body text table tbody tr td p font a strong span  ,Product and Services Bundling,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"The study of bundling can be approached from a variety of perspectives, such as information processing, transaction cost analysis, and competitive advantage. Specific research topics include how consumers select between competing bundles (i.e., how information processing differs when compared to selecting between individual products), the role of bundling in reducing churn in the marketplace, and the optimal configuration of the bundle (the number of products in the bundle as well as the relationship between the products in the bundle)",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font a strong strong span  ,Relationship Marketing,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td p strong font span  ,"In recent years firms have realized that they can leverage their value chains and achieve payoffs such as lower coordination costs, greater market access, and the delivery of quality service by initiating, developing, and enhancing long-term cooperation relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. A sampling of research areas in this field include, relationship initiation strategies through the use of market-place signals and social/structural bonds, relationship termination strategies involving hostages, idiosyncratic (specific) investments, and switching costs, etc.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p strong font a strong span  ,Information Processing and Individual Decision Making,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td p strong font span  ,"The area of information processing borrows heavily from psychology as well as economics. In recent years, research has focused on dynamic aspects of consumer preference (i.e., how choices and preferences change over time), information acquisition and use in Judgments (i.e., how people search for information and use information in their decisions), advertising exposure and attitude change (how attitudes are affected by advertising), and customer satisfaction and loyalty.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p strong a strong font span  ,Competitive Marketing Strategies,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td p strong font span  ,"This is an area of immense importance to marketing managers and research in this field requires an understanding of areas outside of traditional marketing such as economics (e.g., game theory) and finance (Capital Asset Pricing Models). One area of study is the wireless telecommunications industry. In this area, one could potentially research how consumers adopt new tecnologies, how should the different telecommunication services be optimally priced given that there are strong cross elasticity across services, and what is the optimum service portfolio.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p strong font a strong span  ,Judgment and Decision Making,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td p strong font span  ,"The study of judgment and decision making is rooted in Behavioral Decision Theory, or BDT, which studies how consumers form judgments and make choices in the marketplace. It is often described as a descriptive alternative to the more normative economic theories of rational choice. In the marketing context, BDT is applied in areas such as (1) the introduction of new products and services, (2) judgment and decision making among multi-attribute options, (3) the influence of market signals on price and quality perceptions, and (4) the impact of description frames on communication and personal selling.",1,11
