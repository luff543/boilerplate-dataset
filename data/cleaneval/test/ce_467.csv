html body text font p span  ,The result was a dramatic decrease in their numbersafter 355 B.C.,1,6
html body text font p span  ,"But in the periodunder consideration here, we see that it's the metics, slaves and former slaveswho, having little or nothing to lose, are the entrepreneurs",1,6

html body text font p span  ,"Fromthe above we can safely conclude that this form of ""rudimentaryadoption"" required a certain degree of financial capability, not only forthe day-to-day upkeep, but for the long term expenses as well",1,6
html body text font p b span  ,.,1,7
html body text font p span  ,"Afinancial capability that may well have been within the reach of a middle classcitizen as far as the original purchase price was concerned, but over the years,with the ever-increasing competition from the metics and the freed slaves,together with the reduction of the value of land caused by pillage andinterminable wars, this capability was constricted more and more",1,6

html body text font p span  ,"To thepoint, in many instances, where the citizen-owner was forced to either rent outhis slaves, allow them to set up on their own in order to reduce his costs, or,as a last resort, manumit them",1,6

html body text font p span  ,"Should one wonder just what kind ofadvantages a citizen-owner could expect from manumitting a slave, we can thinkof two that come immediately to mind",1,6
html body text font p b span  ,:,1,7
html body text font p span  ,"1) his expenses were reduced becausehe was no longer responsible for the slave's care and feeding, and 2) hereceiveda significant sum of money in the form of either a lump sum payment or a steady incomeover time, as consideration for granting the slave's freedom",1,6

html body text font p b span  ,.,1,7
html body text font p span  ,"We take note, therefore, that in the4th century B.C., a slave received an equal salary with a freeborn juror, and aslightly lower salary than a magistrate or a member of parliament",1,6

html body text font p span  ,"Anycomparison with more modern times regarding this issue is sure to leave us withmany questions pertaining to the definition of the word ""slave,"" thenand now",1,6

html body text font p span  ,"Wefurther take note that in 400 B.C., a family of 3, together with their 2 slaves,had a yearly expenditure of 1000 drachmas, whereas, in 370 B.C., the youngDem�sthenes, with his mother and sister, and with no slaves, needed 700drachmas per year",1,6

html body text font p span  ,Letus turn now to the much-heralded and much-bemoaned slaves who worked in themines of La�rium,1,6

html body text font p span  ,The importance ofthese mines (right through to about 370 B.C.) was negligible after the revolt of themetal-working slaves which took place during the last few years of the PeloponnesianWar,1,6

html body text font p span  ,"Addto this the fact that only a small number of poor Athenian citizens worked therefor their own benefit -- which indicates to us that production had fallen agreat deal -- and we can understand why there was a crisis at the mines at thistime, and why the whole operation was in a very bad state.",1,6
html body text font p span  ,"Whenconsidering that the majority of the slaves working in the mines were leased,that the freeborn mine operators were paying a minimum of 1 obol per day to theirmasters, and that they had the further expense of clothing and feeding theircharges -- in addition to which they had to contend with a general economicdepression in the Athenian economy due to Athens' defeat in the aforementionedwar -- we can see why the wages of the slaves at La�rium were not up to par",1,6
html body text font p b span  ,.,1,7
html body text font p span  ,"We then come to realize that the revolt was not due to any ill-treatment ofthe slaves, but was most likely the result of the slaves coming to theconclusion that, considering the arduous labor involved, working in the metal mines was not a profitable enoughoccupation",1,6
html body text font p b span  ,.,1,7
html body text font p span  ,"This realization isstrengthened by the later indifference on the part of the venture capitalists tocontinue operations in La�rium, which allowed the poor citizens of Athens tocome in and try to scratch out a living",1,6

html body text font p span  ,Whyweren't there any revolts during the many years that the mines were productiveunder Athenian hegemony? The answer is simple,1,6
