html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p a strong small font span  ,Does it matter who divorces whom?,1,20
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"There are some disadvantages in being the one who is divorced. Firstly, you can be ordered to pay the legal fees for the divorce; this may seem (and often is) extremely unfair, a case of adding injury to insult. This is based on the old principle in the courts that if you prove your case then you get your costs, despite the fact that it is not always appropriate in the family justice system. However, if the practicalities of the actual divorce are agreed by both parties, it is also possible to agree that the two of you will share the legal fees between you, or indeed that the person who actually files the petition will not seek an order for costs against the spouse.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Secondly, you may have the unpleasantness of being on the receiving end of some legal description of your private life, especially if the divorce is based on unreasonable behaviour. It is possible to file an Answer to the allegations and try to regain control of the process by forcing a compromise on the allegations made, but most prefer to avoid the legal complications and significant expense of doing so. Nevertheless, allegations made as to unreasonable behaviour do often stick in the gullet as the contents of the Petition rarely have much to do with why the marriage broke down.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"But who petitions against whom rarely spills over in to other more important areas, such as the children or finance. It is worth just checking that none of the allegations in the Petition relate to dealing with the children or to financial issues, since once the divorce is granted, those allegations become a finding of fact. Unless it is specifically agreed beforehand, these findings can be referred to in linked proceedings.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"The usual way of preventing such difficulties - and much acrimony too - is to offer the Petition in draft before it is sent to the court. Any items that cause particular upset can be discussed and either watered down or left out. This is not something that everyone has to do, but is very much in the spirit of the SFLA Code of Practice.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,An early discussion with an SFLA solicitor can help resolve some of these issues.,1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p a small font strong span  ,Is there going to be a new law of divorce?,1,20
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"The Family Law Act 1996 was passed in a fanfare, hailed as going some way towards removing acrimony in the divorce process by getting rid of the concept of 'fault'. However, the Government has since announced that those parts of the Act dealing with divorce will not now come into force.",1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"If the divorce is going to take place in England and Wales, it is possible to get any County Court that is empowered to deal with divorce to issue proceedings.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"It is usual to use your local court for convenience's sake. Some use a court that is out of their area for fear of coming into contact with people they know in the local context (Mrs Simpson used Ipswich!). The Principal Registry in London is used by many who do not live there, for a mixture of all of these reasons or perhaps they believe that that court will handle their case better.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Practices and judicial attitudes vary from court to court. Experienced solicitors with knowledge of the system sometimes choose a particular court for a particular case, to try and gain some advantage for their client.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"But for the vast majority of cases it is convenience that is the deciding factor - convenience for the solicitors particularly, since they will charge for their travel time to court. In any event courts have the power to order cases to be transferred to the court that is most appropriate - in the view of the judge rather than anyone else.",1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p a small font strong span  ,Do children automatically live with their mother?,1,20
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,Married parents share joint parental responsibility and come before the Court as equals. The children's welfare is the court's paramount consideration.,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"If there is a dispute as to with which parent the children should live, one or other of them must issue an application for a Residence Order. In considering which parent is best able to meet the child's best interests, the Court will apply the ""welfare checklist"" (s1(3) Children Act 1989).",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,The application of the Welfare Checklist points towards pragmatism:,1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote ul li small font span  ,"Even if there is little to choose between the two parents in terms of their actual parenting skills, are the work commitments of one more conducive to having primary care of the children? This last consideration is often fundamental and traditionally, has tended to work in favour of mothers, but increasingly, this need not necessarily be the case.",1,19
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote ul li small font span  ,"Even where one parent does have a Residence Order in his or her favour, that does not alter the fact that the other parent retains parental responsibility and has an important role to play in the child's life. In theory at least, a Residence Order is not a passport to making important decisions about the child's upbringing on a unilateral basis.",1,19
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote ul li small font span  ,"In the case of unmarried parents, the mother has sole parental responsibility until the father acquires it by way of an agreement, or Court Order. He will however be granted parental responsibility automatically if he has a Residence Order in his favour.",1,19
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote ul li small font span  ,"In the case of very young children, it is a fact that courts tend to assume they are better off living with their mother unless clearly shown to the contrary. Nevertheless, there is no presumption of law and the courts have to consider each case on its individual merits. Although the odds may seem stacked against a father, the facts may mean that this is not necessarily the case.",1,19

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p a small font strong span  ,Is a 50/50 split the usual financial settlement?,1,20
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Recent cases concerning 'big money' - where the assets available for division clearly exceed the parties' needs - have focused on the concept of equality of outcome. This may or may not mean that the assets are divided 50/50 in these cases. What it does mean is that contributions to the running of the home and the bringing up of children are valued equally by the court on divorce to contributions made by economically rewarding work. There may be other considerations - for example, the liquidity of the assets making up the family pot, or any inheritances received, or particularly bad financial conduct on one side, which dictate that the outcome should not be equal. Fairness is the key - and a 50/50 split will not be fair in all cases.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,Each case has to be looked at individually. It depends on the circumstances of those involved.,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"In most cases, the financial settlement will reflect what each person needs fundamentally, money to pay all the bills and to sort out somewhere to live.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Having an equal split is sometimes the starting point, but a lot of other factors have to be taken into account.",1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,But if there is a risk that large sums may be drawn out - or if there is a risk that credit or charge cards may be used inappropriately - then it may be safer to take action to prevent this.,1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"You need to check the way in which your home is owned. Is it in your sole name? If it is, it will pass under the terms of your will or intestacy.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"There are two ways of owning a home jointly - as equitable joint tenants, or as tenants-in-common.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Many couples own their home as joint tenants, which means in such a way that if one of them dies, the other owns the property outright automatically.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,This arrangement may still be the right one after separation - at least for the time being.,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,It is possible though to change the way in which you own any property jointly - so that if one of you dies then his or her share passes to their estate and is then dealt with under their will i.e. to set up a tenancy-in-common. This is called severing the joint tenancy by giving a formal Notice of Severance to the other joint owner.,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,Your solicitor can prepare this for you. You should always take advice on this point because it may lead to claims against your estate if you die.,1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p a small font strong span  ,Can I change my childâ€™s surname?,1,20
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Neither parent, nor indeed any other person, can change a childâ€™s surname without the written consent of every person with parental responsibility or the leave of the Court. Even in cases where the parents are unmarried, the Court has suggested that such a step should generally not be taken without either the other parent's agreement or a court decision. Changing a childâ€™s surname is obviously a very emotive step, since the surname may provide an important link to the parent with whom the child does not normally live; it may also express a preference to be known as the child of the step-parent.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"The Court will not consider it appropriate to change a childâ€™s surname just because it is different to that of their halfâ€“orâ€“step-siblings, nor even simply because the child wants it changed. The Court will not sanction a change in surname lightly; there is a presumption in favour of the status quo.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Increasingly, children may be part of a step-family in which children do not all share the same surname. It is therefore important that any such proposal is very carefully thought through and justifiable on quite strict grounds, such as where there is no ongoing relationship whatsoever with the other biological parent and so to retain that name causes distress and confusion.",1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,The uppermost consideration for the Court in considering whether a change of surname is appropriate is the childâ€™s welfare and best interests. It is everything to do with the rights of the child and nothing to do with any asserted parental rights. How those best interests are met will depend upon balancing a range of factors including:,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote ul li small font span  ,the original surname with which the child was registered and whether all the circumstances justify such a change (ie. is there a good enough reason?);,1,19

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote ul li small font span  ,the strength of the child's connection with the current surname.,1,19
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"In certain instances the Court has made a distinction between a childâ€™s ""official"" name and the name by which the child chooses to be known; this to be particularly relevant with an older child, although the parents themselves would be obliged not to cause them to be known by anything other than the official name. However, in another case involving teenage children the Court decided that the fatherâ€™s surname should be kept in the face of opposition from the children and in circumstances where no contact was taking place in order to underline the importance of the paternal link.",1,18
