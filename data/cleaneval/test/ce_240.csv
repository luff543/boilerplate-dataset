When the United States, with other United Nations, came to the aid ofthe South Koreans, a 3-year war resulted that cost more than 142,000 Americanbattle casualties.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The campaigns set in motion by the invasion of South Korea later werecharacterized as a ""limited war."" The fighting was deliberatelyconfined in geographic terms, political decisions placed restrictions uponmilitary strategy, and none of the belligerents, with the exception of the twoKorean governments, used its full military potential. But there was nothinglimited about the ferocity of the battles.",1,5

Suppression and ill-use have been the heritage of itslong-suffering people. Few habitable areas of the earth are more unsuited tolarge-scale, modern military operations. The rugged landscape, a lack ofadequate roads, rail lines, and military harbors, the narrow peninsula, and, notleast, climatic extremes restrict and hamper maneuver, severely limit logisticsupport, and intensify the normal hardships of war.",1,5

In the north, a river-mountain complex separates Koreafrom Manchuria and the maritime provinces of the USSR. Eastward, across the Seaof Japan, the Japanese islands flank the peninsula. To the west, the Yellow Seastands between Korea and China. The Korean peninsula stretches south for morethan 500 miles, while east and west, it spans only 220 miles at its widest.Thousands of islets, some scarcely more than large rocks, rim its 5,400-milecoastline.",1,5

The facetious claim that Korea, ironed flat, wouldcover the whole world has an element of truth, for the terrain throughout thepeninsula is mountainous. Roads and railways wind through tortuous valleys.Ice-free ports exist on Korea's southern and western coasts, but the lattershore is distinguished by some of the most extreme tidal variations in theworld. On the eastern shore, there are only a few adequate harbors. Althoughgeographers place Korea in a temperate zone, the classification hardly mitigatesthe harsh winters, particularly in the wind-swept northern mountains, or thesweltering, dusty, and no less harsh summers in the south.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"The forces shaping Korea into a nation arose from its unfortunate proximity tothree powers, China, Japan, and Russia. The periodic surges of ambition in eachof these neighbors turned Korea into a battleground and a spoil. Sometimesdescribed as a ""dagger pointed at the heart of Japan,"" Korea becameinstead Japan's steppingstone to the Asian mainland. For China and, later,Russia, Korea was a back gate both to be locked against intruders and to beopened during any opportunity for expansion. Korea's ice-free ports fronting theSea of Japan were especially coveted by the Russians. Korea therefore has seldombeen completely free of domination by one of its stronger neighbors. [1]",1,5

By the 7th century,A.D., the Chinese had forced their thought, customs, and manners into the Koreanculture and had turned Korea into a virtual satellite. Late in that century, anative dynasty, Chinese-controlled, unified the peninsula. Before then Japan hadoccasionally invaded southern Korea, but with little lasting effect. Badlydefeated by the Koreans in 663 A.D., Japan retired for nearly a thousand years.",1,5

Having occupied Korea to fight Russia, Japan leftits troops there. Ignoring Korean objections, Japan disbanded the Korean Armyand abolished the Korean Department of Post and Communications. It allowed asemblance of self-rule in Korea for several years, but remained the real master.Japanese seizure of governmental functions, the forced abdication of Korea'sEmperor, and encroachment in all aspects of Korean society culminated in anagreement in July 1907 placing Korea completely under Japanese control.

Judged in Japanese courtsunder Japanese laws, they received severe sentences for minor offenses, moresevere than those given Japanese for similar infractions. TheJapanese-controlled Bank of Chosen charged Koreans interest rates 25 percenthigher than those assessed Japanese competitors. The Korean national debtincreased thirty-fold between 1910 and 1945, and the taxation of Koreans wasoppressive. In most industries, Japanese received twice as much as Koreans doingthe same work.

It originated on 1 March 1919 when a declaration ofindependence, signed by Korean students, was read before a student gathering inSeoul. The Japanese ruthlessly hunted down the instigators of this declaration,and many patriots fled Korea to escape torture and death.

Thenearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

Gardner pointed out that the 39thParallel would place Dairen in the military zone to be occupied by theAmericans. General Lincoln, however, felt that the Russians would hardly accepta surrender line that barred them from Dairen and other parts of the LiaotungPeninsula; besides, American units would have great difficulty reaching theManchurian port ahead of the Russians.

Russian troops then poured out of themaritime provinces of Siberia, down the Korean peninsula, and into theKaesong-Ch'unch'on area above Seoul, where they looted much equipment, includinglocomotives and rolling stock. Reports of the Russian troop movements reachingWashington underscored the need for concurrence in the proposed general order.Otherwise, the Russian advance would render academic the American acceptance ofthe Japanese surrender in southern Korea. At the same time, swift Russian troopmovements into key areas of southern Manchuria eliminated the possibility ofincluding Dairen in the American surrender zone.",1,5

Within afew hours President Truman gave his approval, directing at the same time thatGeneral Order No. 1 be sent also to the capitals of Great Britain and the USSRwith requests for concurrence by the heads of those states.

He asked that the general order be ""corrected""to authorize Russian forces to accept the surrender of the Japanese in thenorthern half of Hokkaido. Stalin also reminded the President that the LiaotungPeninsula, upon which Dairen and Port Arthur are located, was part of Manchuriaand thus within the USSR military zone. Though President Truman parried Stalin'sproposal to place Russian forces on Hokkaido, Stalin's message settled thesurrender zones in Korea and canceled American plans to land troops at Dairen.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"South of the 38th Parallel, the American zone covered 37,000 square miles andheld an estimated 21,000,000 persons. North of the line of latitude, the USSRzone totaled 48,000 square miles and had about 9,000,000 people. [19] Of the 20principal Korean cities, 12 lay within the American zone, including Seoul, thelargest, with a population of nearly 2,000,000. The American zone included 6 ofKorea's 13 provinces in their entirety, the major part of 2 more, and a smallpart of another. The two areas, North and South Korea, complemented each otherboth agriculturally and industrially. South Korea was mainly a farming area,where fully two-thirds of the inhabitants worked the land. It possessed threetimes as much irrigated rice land as the northern area, and furnished food forthe north. But North Korea furnished the fertilizer for the southern ricefields, and the largest nitrogenous fertilizer plant in the Far East was inHungnam. Although North Korea also had a high level of agricultural production,it was deficient in some crops. The barrier imposed serious adverse effects onboth zones. [20]",1,5

In 1940, North Korea produced 86 percent of Korea's heavy manufacturedgoods. The only petroleum processing plant in the country, a major installationdesigned to serve all of Korea, was located in the north, as were seven of eightcement plants.

North Koreans viewed southerners as lazy schemers. Duringthe Japanese occupation Koreans in the north had been much less tractable thanthose in the south. Differences in farming accounted for some of the socialdifferences in the two zones. A dry-field type of farming in the north opposed arice-culture area in the south to produce marked variations in points of view.In the south were more small farms and a high tenancy rate, while in the northlarger farms and more owner-farmers prevailed. Those differences the 38thParallel promised to exacerbate.",1,5
