html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Dormitory Council President Jeffrey C. Roberts ’02 said he had known about the proposal as early as December. Dormcon didn’t inform the public of the status of the proposal because it felt it did not have enough details to advertise, said Dormcon Vice President Matthew S. Cain ’02. “It was basically a big miscommunication,” Cain said.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Roberts added that when he was first informed, the proposal “was not a plan ... my expectation was that when it became a plan, [the dormitories involved] would be be the first to hear. We just had a breakdown in communication.”",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The administration had also communicated with the Undergraduate Association and the Graduate Student Council, O’Dair said.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“One thing we’ve learned is that we need to use multiple communication mechanisms, because as it is, the word doesn’t get out,” O’Dair said.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“I was pretty pleased with the outcome of the meeting,” said Senior House resident M. Maitland Lederer ’03. “I was glad to see communication [between students and administrators] and not just yelling and name-calling.”",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“It’s clear that Dean Benedict cares about the well-being of the students,” said Senior House resident Geoffrey L. Goodell ’01.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"However, Goodell expressed reservations about the administration’s failure to provide students with a long-term plan.

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"“Among grad students, we like the concept of having another person to help with residential life,” said GSC Housing and Community Affairs Chair Shunmugavelu D. Sokka. “Undergraduates have a lot of support already, but we favor any help we can get.”",1,9
