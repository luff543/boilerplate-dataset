html body text span  ,"Since many film types were only available from the film manufacturers in35mm stock, several submini camera manufacturers designed film splittersto allow cutting a smaller strip of film from 35mm stock. With a film slitter,you can get some amazing film into your submini, such as 2475 recording film,B&W or color infrared film, Tech pan, Agfapan 25 and Ektar 25. Sometimes called film slitters -- and NOT to be confused with filmSPLICERS -- these devices came in various styles to cut different size strips.Some cut a 35mm strip in half to produce two 17.5mm strips for cameras thatused that size film. Others would cut 16mm strips, 9.5mm strips and even8mm strips. Some of the companies that made these slitters were GaMi, Minolta,Yashica, Ricoh, Mikroma, Microtec, Acmel, and Varitype. There are undoubtedlymore. They basically work the same way. Using razor blades, of some type,they cut out smaller strips of film from 35mm film. These items are no longerbeing made and are very difficult to find.",1,4

html body text p span  ,"If you are handy or determined, you might even want to built your own slitter.All you need are a few small pieces of wood, a couple of razor blades, somebasic tools, a little ingenuity and time. Here are some pictures ofa completed splitter. With this slitter, you place a bulk roll of 35mm filmon the part that looks like a black handle. The film is pressed down ontothe cutting block and a removeable pressure plate is screwed on top. Thenthe film is pulled through the slitter and rolled up on the other side. Twopieces of felt on either side of the film keep it from getting scratched.",1,5
html body text span  ,"You can use various materials in the construction of your slitter. Thedecision on material is up to you. Wood is normally easier to workwith if you just have standard tools, but other materials may offer advantages,if you are familiar with them and have the necessary tools. In buildingyour own slitter, one big problem you will come across is that the film ismeasured in millimeters, but American building materials are normally cutin inches. To complicate matters even more, when you add in the razor bladesinbetween the wood blocks, the width is increased very slighly, but it canbe enough to through off careful measurements. Here are some helpfulmeasurements:",1,4

html body text span  ,"You can see from these diagrams is that if you only use one size of filmto slit from (ex. 35mm) and one size of film to slit to (ex. 16mm) your jobwill be easier. If you plan on slitting from different film sizes (ex.35mm AND 16mm), or slit to different film sizes (ex. 16mm AND 9.5mm) yourwork is more involved. You will need to make different film slittersor make a slitter with different slitting block pieces. It's up toyou to decide which is the best route to take.",1,4

html body text p span  ,"Making a slitter takes time even if you are familiar with hand tools. Themeasurements must be precise and the pieces of material are small, makingcutting difficult. It also makes it easy to cut yourself, so watchout!",1,5

The plans outlined here are generic plans andneed to be modified depending on the type of film you plan to slit, the typeof film you want to produce, the type of materials you plan to use and thefeatures you want to built into the slitter. You will first need tospend time designing your slitter using these diagrams as a starting point. If you have trouble designing your slitter, it's best not to buildone yourself.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The amount of wood used in the project is very small. Becasue of thisyou can probably afford to move up from a soft wood, like pine, to a harderwood, like oak. Your slitter will last longer, but your saws and drillbits won't. Harder woods are trickier to work with.",1,5
