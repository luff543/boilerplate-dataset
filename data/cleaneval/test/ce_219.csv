html body text div div div p span  ,"Yesterday we were taking Charlie for a ride -- ostensibly to the cheese-and-chocolate outlet by way of the gas station that for no good reason appears to charge 20 cents a gallon less than anywhere else in the state. He's been a bit fussy since getting stabbed three times in the leg for his six-month birthday, and we thought it might calm him. (As a science geek, I also pointed out that if he started crying really loud we could just run the car up to mach 1 and outrun the soundwaves.)",1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"Of course, halfway through the trip Charlie went from twisting his head around to look forward at me with big appealing eyes to calling out for attention to calling out rather more urgently for food. No problem, we just waited him out for a few miles and pulled into the first available parking lot, at a disused carwash, and I got the bottle out of his carefully prestocked bag. He fit neatly across my lap as he ate, only occasionally kicking his carseat or thumping his head against the passenger door.",1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,Cue one gastrocolic reflex. Also no problem -- the bag has long been stocked with diapers -- in his current size yet -- and moist wipes. Which were after a month or so of no in-car events about as moist as a civil-defense cracker from 1955.,1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"We are gifted improvisers, and Charlie did just fine being changed and mostly cleaned under the shelter of a liftgate and an open carwash booth. Whoever empties the dumpster at the apartments across the way, my thanks and apologies.",1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"So now we know to rotate our stock of moist wipes, and all the more-experienced folks out there are shaking their heads at the exponentially more messy hijinks that await us. But every day we do something new with Charlie without utterly screwing up I like to imagine at least a tiny glow of accomplishment, and that was yesterday's.",1,8

About an hour into our negotiations, Madeline spit up all over herself and me, so I changed her and spot-cleaned my t-shirt with those Huggies wipes. Very soon thereafter, she had the worst blowout of her life while being held up against that same t-shirt. I had to 1) throw-out the diaper and the one-piece outfit she as wearing in the dealership ladies room, 2) rinse off the vomit splattered outfit I had just changed her out of in the sink, 3)dress her in said wet and vomit stained outfit, 4)take off my own poop and vomit stained shirt and wash it in the sink (I highly reccommend adding some Shout Wipes to your diaper bag), and 5)go out into the dealership in my wet t-shirt to tell my husband I didn't care what he had to agree to in order for us to leave immediately.",1,8

html body text div div div p span  ,Everyone knows that you can tell a kid's birth order by the size of the diaper bag: full suitcase = firstborn; knapsack or tidy shoulder-bag = secondborn; one disposable diaper stuck in pocket of Mom's purse = everyone from there on.,1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"I pushed the limits of those time-tested rules with one of my kids. Set out for a walk around the neighbourhood with NO diaper bag of any kind and a CLOTH-DIAPERED kid in the stroller. One thing led to another and I found myself on foot much farther from home than I'd planned--over the river and a long walk from the next bridge. I went to the grocery story and bought a cheap pack of dishcloths, pinned them triumphantly in place on my child, tied filthy diaper and plastic pants securely in the grocery store's plastic bag, and booted it home in haste before he soaked through the nice new fabric. (Um humm, our grandmas didn't have plastic pants, can you imagine.) Thank god I had packed my wallet!!",1,8
