html body text ul li span  ,The care of all the different species of trees is essentially the same.,1,6
html body text ul li span  ,"As soon as you arrive home place the tree in a bucket of water. Should the sap onthe butt ofthe tree have become ""crusty"", cut a thin slice (about 1/2"" thick) off the butt and place it inwater immediately. This is not necessary if you are using the new intravenous wateringsystem.",1,6
html body text ul li span  ,Leave the netting on the tree until you install the stand and bring it indoors. Thenettingmakes it much easier to get the tree through doors and halls.,1,6
html body text ul li span  ,"Locate the tree well away from sources of heat, such as fireplaces, heater vents,space heatersand stoves.",1,6
html body text ul li span  ,"An anti-transpirant is helpful in keeping your tree fresh. If the trees were not treatedin thefield, you may want to treat it yourself.",1,6
html body text ul li span  ,Keep in mind that all trees can consume large amounts of water. But the LeylandsandSapphires are unbelievable. You should expect them to consume 2-3 gallons per day. Waterconsumption decreases as time progresses. The extent to which you care for your tree willdetermine it freshness during the Christmas season.,1,6
html body text ul li span  ,"Christmas tree safety is very important and its your responsibility. There has neverbeen acase where a Christmas tree auto-ignited. Most fires originate from faulty wiring in thelights.Before you string the lights on the tree, test each string. If they are not working properly andcan not be readily repaired, discard them and purchase new ones. The risk of a fire is notworth the cost of a string of lights. Always unplug the lights at bed time or when you aregoing to be out of the house.",1,6

html body text i span  ,"(Harold Odom, inventor)",1,5
html body text h4 span  ,"This new tree stand can actually save marriages by making the setup of the annualChristmas treeso simple and easy that the customary family bickering and fighting is all but eliminated. Thetwo primary functions of a Christmas tree stand are; first, to hold the tree and; second, toprovidea means of adjustment so that it can be plumbed vertically. The Standtastic stand has separateand independent features to accomplish these two primary functions. The handle of the tree issecured in the trough of the support bracket using two quick release bands (hose clamps).Thebands are tightened using a screwdriver. Stand the tree up by tipping it over on the two longlegs.Use your foot to extend the remaining short leg. With the tree standing, adjust the thumbscrewsto obtain the required vertical orientation. In the case of large heavy trees, it may benecessary tolift the weight off the leg being adjusted to make the thumb screw easier to turn. Keep inmindthat, a small change in the leg angle will make large change in the tree position. So, thethumbscrews should be adjusted in 1/4 turn or 1/2 turn increments.",1,5
html body text h4 span  ,"Once the entire family is satisfied with the tree position, a separate water bowl can beplacedunder the butt of the tree, or the I-V can be installed. Because the water bowl is left behindwhenthe tree is being taken down, the possibility of spilling the water is greatly reduced.",1,5

html body text i span  ,internal watering system,1,5
html body text h4 span  ,"This system replaces the conventional ""butt in bowl"" watering apparatus. It consists ofa syphontube, two expanding rubber sleeves, a pinch valve and a used gallon milk jug as a waterreservoir. Two 1/2"" diameter holes are drilled in to the woody tissue of the tree trunk. Thesyphon is started by covering the vent hole in the jug stopper and squeezing the jug. Oncethesyphon has been established, the flow is stopped using the pinch valve. The expanding rubbersleeves are place into the drilled holes in the trunk. The pinch valve is opened and the flowofwater to the tree begins. Capillary act carries the water up the trunk and out the branches tothetree foliage, keeping it fresh and pliable.",1,5
html body text h4 span  ,"This watering system has a number of significant advantages. The water reservoir isreadilyvisible. It is not covered by the tree skirt and Christmas packages. So, there is no question astowhen it needs refilling. The reservoir is easily refilled. Simply close the pinch valve, removethesyphon tube and stopper, bring the jug to the faucet, fill it, return it to the tree, replace thestopper and tube, and open the pinch valve. Since the entire system is closed, the waterneverbecomes contaminated or stagnant. When it's time for the tree to come down, simply removethejug, the syphon tube and expanding sleeves. The tree is now ready to be moved with no riskofspilling an attached water bowl. Allow the tubes to drain and dry; and store the system tilnextyear.",1,5
html body text h4 span  ,"While the tree is up, a drip pan should be placed on the floor under the butt of thetree so that anydripping sap, or water, will not stain the carpet.",1,5
