html body text p font strong span  ,THE COMING OUT PROCESS,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Identifying oneself aslesbian or gay and disclosing this to other people is oftenreferred to as 'Coming Out'.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,There are three main issuesassociated with coming out which schools need to be aware of:,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,�,0,7
html body text p strong span span  ,'Coming out' is a necessary and ultimately positive experiencefor most young people who grow up lesbian or gay.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,"It cantake place in the years between starting and leaving secondaryschool. In this period, coming to terms with confusion aboutidentity can affect a young person's social relationships, schoolwork and self-esteem both negatively and positively.",1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,�,0,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Many young lesbian and gay people experience critical times whenthey have to decide who to tell about their sexuality.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,"Inmaking this disclosure they are often fearful of negativereactions, rejection and causing upset and distress to the personthey are telling.",1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Sometimes a young person may try 'comingout' to a supportive teacher or a school friend as a precursor totalking to parents in order to rehearse their own part and tojudge reactions.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Receiving a negative reaction can be verydistressing.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,�,0,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Support and guarantees of safety are valuable to young people'coming out'.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,The availability of secure and confidentialgroups or contacts can be instrumental in reducing anxiety whichis only magnified by feelings of isolation.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,The presence ofrole models in the shape of adults who 'come out' and those whooffer non-judgmental support and help young people access thesegroups can be important.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,"Positive treatment by, and contactwith, role models can also encourage them to feel confident abouttheir future.",1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Thereare several theories about the elements of the 'coming out'process.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Each has its own emphasis but all of them regard'coming out' as a series of stages.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,These stages do notnecessarily last the same length of time and there is no one agewhen the whole process begins and ends.,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,These stages can bedescribed as follows:,1,7
html body text p strong span span  ,Stage 1- Sensitisation,1,7
html body text strong p strong span span  ,G9 said,1,8
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"""I was probably always a loner anyway, afraid to let anyone�in�, so I was a bit of an oddity among mycontemporaries anyway.""",1,9
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Andrewsaid,1,8
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"""Only now do I realise the level ofharassment, bullying and mental torture that I endured while atschool.",1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"I was never like all the other boys, alwaysexcluded from all the social activities that the majorityenjoyed.",1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"For years I pondered as to why this was. Why was Ibeing treated differently and castigated by others to such alonely life?""",1,9
html body text strong p strong span span  ,In this stage a persongenerally begins to feel 'different' to other people of the samesex.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Sometimes they recognise that they are not veryinterested in people of the opposite sex but more often they feelthey are not really interested in things which are supposed to beappropriate for their sex.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Most people report just feelingunusual when they compare themselves to other people of theirsex.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Commonly this happens before or in early adolescencewhen friendships and relationships between the sexes begin tochange.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Roughlyhalf the LGB men and women surveyed felt 'different' by the ageof 11.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Stage 2- Confusion about identity,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,G28 said,1,8
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"""I tried not to think about it as I feltdisgusted and repulsed if I dared think of fellow class-mates ina sexual way.",1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,I shuddered at the thought of themdiscovering how I felt and thought so I never really thought ofbeing a gay person at school due to the fact that I pretended tobe 'straight' .,1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"Therefore, being gay at school is a life ofpretence, lies and denial.",1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"Living in fear of beingdiscovered due to the ensuing consequences.""",1,9
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Thereare usually four elements which contribute to confusion aboutidentity:,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,�,0,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Feeling that perceptions of the self are altering;,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,�,0,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Feeling and experiencing heterosexual and homosexual sexualarousal;,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,�,0,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Sensing the stigma surrounding homosexuality;,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,�,0,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Lacking knowledge about homosexuality.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"Research indicates that mostyoung gay men first decide they are probably gay between the agesof 12 and 17, and most young lesbian women first decide they areprobably lesbian between the ages of 16 and 20. At this time theyhave to deal with feeling that they have changed as have theirrelationships with other people around them.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Some also haveto combat the potentially powerful feelings of self-recriminationand disgust that come from describing themselves as homosexual.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,There are various strategies for coping with this emotionalupheaval.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Some young people who thinkthey are lesbian or gay will try to deny it to themselves andeven seek help to eradicate their feelings.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Others will tryand avoid thoughts and feelings which remind them that they havehomosexual inclinations.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,In these situations young peoplecan avoid getting any information about sexuality in order toavoid confirming their suspicions about their orientation.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Some young people have greatdifficulty in managing their relationships with peers and family.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,They may avoid situations in which they may encounteropportunities for heterosexual pairing so that they are notforced to deal with their lack of sexual interest in members ofthe opposite sex or have it exposed.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"They may,alternatively, persevere with heterosexual relationships to tryand 'convert' themselves and/or conceal their homosexuality fromothers.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,In some extreme cases young people may try to avoidconfronting their feelings by expressing strong homophobia orturning to drink and drugs in order to find temporary relief fromthem.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"Finally, some young people fallback on a strategy of redefining their feelings and behaviour insuch a way as to convince themselves that it is not reallyhomosexual.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"For example, they may describe theirexperiences as a 'phase' or a 'one-off' or they may put them downto extreme emotional or physical circumstances such as thebreak-up of a relationship or drunkenness at a party. In thisstage feelings are becoming more concrete.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Young people maywell have partners of both sexes and may well find their moodsand feelings shifting as they feel more or less certain abouttheir identity.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,This period often lasts throughoutadolescence.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,It is important to note that50% of gay and bisexual boys surveyed knew they were gay by 11�and of lesbian and bisexual girls by 12�.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"By 13, 80% oflesbian and bisexual girls are aware that they are gay and by 15,80% of gay and bisexual boys are aware that they are gay.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Mostchildren who later self-identify as gay/bisexual are well aware,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,that they are gay by NI school year 11 (14/15),1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Manyare aware they are gay in NI school year 8 (11/12)!,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Bysixth form practically all gay people know they are gay,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Stage 3 - Assuming a lesbian or gayidentity,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,L10 said,1,8
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"""I never felt so bad about not findingmen attractive in the true sense of the word and it helped meunderstand why I felt like I did for women so it was no longerun-natural.""",1,9
html body text strong p strong span span  ,G26 said,1,8
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"""I was happy to like other boys andsensed that the one boy I fancied was gay as I could feel that hewas interested in me by way of glances and once standing up forme when I was picked on.""",1,9
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"Clearly,living with confusion about identity is emotionally exhaustingand potentially destructive.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,For some young people thisperiod is followed quite quickly by a stage in which they come toaccept their lesbian or gay identity and are able to express itin a positive way.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,For both young men and women growing upmixing with other young gay people - in social settings orthrough support groups - can help them feel able accept to whothey are.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"For some young people, particularly in largertowns and cities, lesbian and gay youth support groups provide asafe environment for 'coming out'.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Elsewhere local andnational lesbian and gay telephone helplines provide a safe spaceand listening ear for young people who want support.,1,8

html body text strong p strong span span  ,Mostboys live with the 'secret' that they are gay for about threeyears in the middle of their school lives.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,90%of girls and 93.4% boys had,1,8

html body text strong p strong span span  ,G28 said,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"""",1,8
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,It made me stronger to face futureprejudice.,1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"It made me more determined to stand up formyself and not let any mindless, ignorant superfluous cavemanprevent me from being what and who I was destined to be.",1,9
html body text strong p strong i span span  ,"Forthat, I can be a better person, proud of myself and mykind.""",1,9
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"The next stage in the processof 'coming out' involves becoming being lesbian or gay openly andrecognising that it is a central aspect of, 'who I am', and, 'howI want to live my life'. Young people begin to feel thathomosexuality is a valid way of life and develop a sense ofcontentment with being lesbian or gay. They often have theexperience of falling in love at this time and, perhaps as aresult, feel more confident, fulfilled and able to combat thesocial stigma that they may suffer.",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,At this time some young lesbianand gay people begin to feel proud of their sexuality. Theexpression of this pride in being lesbian or gay is a powerfulforce in challenging the stigma attached to homosexuality bypeople with prejudiced attitudes and provides positive rolemodels to others less sure about 'coming out'.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Stage 5- Synthesis,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,"No respondents wrote anything thatwould illustrate synthesis,",1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,The person's sexuality becomesa natural part of their life and ceases to impinge on theirconsciousness.,1,8
html body text strong p strong span span  ,Being gay is no longer an issue.,1,8
