html body text span  ,"Many books and articles have been written arguing that someone other thanWilliam Shakespeare, the glover's son from Stratford-upon-Avon, wrote theplays and poems published under his name. There exist sincere andintelligent people who believe there is strong evidence that Edward deVere, Seventeenth Earl of Oxford, was the author of these plays and poems.Yet professional Shakespeare scholars -- those whose job it is to study,write, and teach about Shakespeare -- generally find Oxfordianclaims to be groundless, often not even worth discussing.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Why is this? Oxfordians claim that these scholars are blinded to theevidence by a vested self-interest in preserving the authorship of ""theStratford Man,"" and some more extreme Oxfordians claim that there is anactive conspiracy among orthodox scholars to suppress pro-Oxford evidenceand keep it from the attention of the general public. The truth, however,is far more prosaic. Oxfordians are not taken seriously by theShakespeare establishment because (with few exceptions) they do not followbasic standards of scholarship, and the ""evidence"" they present for theirfantastic scenarios is either distorted, taken out of context, or flat-outfalse.",1,5
