html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,China and Japan both are Asian superpowers. Their good relationship is needed for the betterment of the whole Asian region.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"When have textbooks not been biased? Look at Christopher Columbus, some countries praise him while some despise him. The state of Texas creates its own textbooks that play down the theory of evolution. There are countless other examples. It is the same with Japan and China they create textbooks to reflect their national interest and pride. I feel the reaction is completely out of control.",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The Chinese have a valid point. Japan did commit war crimes atrocities during World War II. However, the war has been over for 60 years. Japan is no longer the same militaristic country that it was in WWII anymore than Germany is. While it's wrong for Japan to whitewash its history, it's equally wrong for China to nurture old hatreds against the Japanese. The Japanese should acknowledge their WWII history and the Chinese should acknowledge Japan's peaceful progress since WWII.",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,I think this problem is going to be continued because the essence of this problem is that China is communism and autocracy.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"The demonstration against the Japanese textbook has not just taken place in China, but also in Malaysia, Vietnam and Korea. But because these countries have small economic relations with Japan, Japan does not care about voices from these countries. On the other hand, China speaks for the rest of Asia, or else Japanese crimes against the whole of Asia would continue to be buried and forgotten, we can forgive, but we cannot forget, millions of victims were all over the Asia, some are still alive and suffering. Even though Japan gave ODA (loan) to many Asian countries, that does not mean Japan has the power to change history or approved textbooks which show a lack of balance. Japan must reflect on its wartime history, not only for China, but also for Malaysia, Korea, and other Asian countries.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,I have personally read China's history textbooks and all its propaganda. Mao's Great Leap Forward that killed millions of their own civilians and the invasion of Tibet are all 'forgotten'.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"I am so appalled to read the comments that Chinese has got no right for justice because of the government's history.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Of course Japan gave lots of pain to north east Asians throughout history. I'm also angry about Japan's action when it comes to talking about history distortion. But before I blame Japan, I have something to talk to the Chinese government. If they claim sovereignty of East China and adjustment about history, they should give Manchuria to Korea and stop writing wrong history about Korea. What I can see through Chinese is just hypocrisy.",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"I represent a minority voice as a Japanese but I think Japan should stop portraying World War II from the victim's perspective and face responsibilities. Regardless of whether you approve of what the Chinese government says or does, the crimes committed by Japan in the past are wrong, and many Asian countries, including China, deserve an acknowledgment from the Japanese government for that.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Changing your history textbooks to alter history is not telling the truth, visiting the shrines of Japanese ""war heroes"" who committed such atrocities is not a sincere apology and demanding justice for the dead is not wrong.",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"At China and Japan's top meeting, China was not going to discuss the history issue nor the anti-Japan demonstrations in China, but rather they proposed five issues to Japan which included China's request that Japan withdraw from supporting Taiwan. What sort of political game is this?",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p b i span  ,"Noriko, Tokyo, Japan",1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The stormy protests in China are nearly over. The message is that Japan will never get a permanent seat in the UN Security Council as long as China has the veto. We are back to square one. Nothing has changed as for the Sino-Japanese relationship. The basic tune of this relationship is still antagonistic.,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font table tbody tr td div div span  ,"Damien Long, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",1,19
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,The Japanese apology is nothing more than sheer repetition of past Japanese PM words of hollow remorse that lacks sincerity. The visits by Japanese lawmakers to the shrine and the justifications of its own textbook revision by diverting the issue further by condemning Chinese texts as extreme were not very helpful. Why utter sorry when you cannot match it with sincere deeds?,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"I see a lot of similarity between what China is doing now and what Japan did in the time leading to World War II; nationalistic education, large military expenditure, and aggression against neighbours. China's selective use of history reminds me of imperial Japan's use of Western colonialism in East Asia as an excuse for its aggression. China seems to think it can get away with anything as long as it keeps bringing up the history.",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"When will the Chinese own up to their invasion of Tibet, and the genocide of Tibetans, which continues to the present day? Their faces should burn with the shame of their self-indulgent hypocrisy concerning Japan.",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The Chinese seem to forget not only their past but their present as well. They are ignoring the their own illegal invasion of Tibet and their appalling actions in that region.,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The Chinese are a corrupt regime - both morally and politically through communism.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"Neither side has been rational in this whole historical debate. Japan refuses to reflect deeply. Chinese fanatics attack Japanese cars and restaurants disregarding the fact that the owners may be Chinese. China seems to forget the good deeds that Japan has done for China since the Meiji restoration in regards to education, scholarships, and other funding. This is not to say that Japan is innocent of its wartime aggression. Yet, China should take into account that the only country that did not break relations with China over Tiananmen was Japan.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Koizumi said the right thing. The world is watching and needs to hear these sorts of statements.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Japan's neighbouring countries don't seem to accept Koizumi's apology.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"While the public display of Hitler's photo and fascist symbols continue to meet serious global condemnations, why does the global community continue to keep silence when Japanese political leaders continue to pay their respect to war criminals in the Yasukuni? Is that the holocaust is more worth talking than the ripe of Nanking, and millions of civilians killed by the Japanese in East and SE Asia, not to mention the sexual assault to women.

It is true that there is a problem that there are government officials who are willing to approve textbooks that are of questionable value, but I have not yet seen any government that does not occasionally get involved in boondoggles.

This does not make them the opinion of all Japanese, or of the Japanese state. The fact is the PM of Japan apologized for Japan's actions in the Pacific War in 1995. As for Yasukuni, there is a startling correlation between Chinese government's complaints about it and the removal of communism to legitimate its power since 1978. No coincidence perhaps? China will not be satisfied unless Japan adopts its version of events, which are clearly distorted. The solution is for China to become democratic, and appreciate that allowing right-wingers to make absurd arguments about their history in public is far less dangerous than force-feeding nationalism to an entire population that has restricted access to other points of view.",1,14
