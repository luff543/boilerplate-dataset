html body text div div p span  ,Being an undergraduate student involves two main expenses: tuition fees and living expenses.,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"We classify all students as UK, EU or international for fees purposes. The amount you will pay for tuition fees and the financial support available to help you with this will depend on your fees classification, which will be determined in accordance with the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997. You will find further information about these Regulations at the following web address:",1,7

The vast majority of other universities will be charging the same. The fee will go up by inflation in each subsequent year. You will not have to pay the money before or during your time at the University. You will only have to start repaying it after you have graduated and are earning more than £15,000 a year. The rate at which you repay the fee will be linked to your income.",1,7
