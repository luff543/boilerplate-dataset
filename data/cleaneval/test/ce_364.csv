html body text div div div p span  ,"Well, it's been just over a week since MeatFest and I have a mid-week luncheon planned. Maybe once a year or so I have some friends come over for a nice lungeon consisting mostly of ... well ... meat. It's good meat and this coming Thursday I plan on having several chickens roasting in a mesquite grill oven.",1,8
html body text div div div p span  ,"I knew it was coming, and wasn't sure if I was up to the task. So the first thing I did was buy a few racks of baby back ribs to hone my skills. They did just fine. I didn't get an after shot because they were so good I just stood over the cutting board and ate what I wanted. Which was mostly all of them. Oh well, what you gonna do?",1,8

html body text div div div div p span  ,"I haven't used briquettes in years. I'm a grilling snob. That being said, I use mesquite hardwood charcoal with water soaked hickory or raw hickory chunks when I can find it. I use one of those round tall charcoal stoves to lite the fire and I get about 1.5 hours out of one stove full. When the grill fire starts to get low, I preburn a load in the round cylinder stove and add full-on burning mesquite love. That way the cooking area doesn't take a temperature nose dive. Depending upon how hungry I am, I can get it done in 3 or 5 hours. Baby ribs take maybe 2 or so. If you can master making fires, you can master cooking with them. If you can't make a decent fire and control it to YOUR needs, you'll never get a consistent food. So get out there and master that fire !!!!!",1,9
