html body text center table tbody tr th p font b span  ,DO YOU KNOW YOUR MOON SIGN?,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"Most of us know our Sun signsâ€""Libra, Aries, Sagittarius, Pisces, and so on through the zodiac. But how many of us know what sign the Moon was in at the moment of our birth? Though people of all sexes have an astrological Moon, women have a special affinity for this mysterious lady of the nightâ€""no matter where you stand in the butch-femme line-up. Luna rules women, moms, the public, the tides, the menstrual cycle, the moods and emotions. She is intuitive and psychic. She symbolizes the great Goddess in all her phases, from maiden to warrior to mother to crone. Planting by Moon sign improves garden production, and planning by Moon sign can improve every phase of your life. The Moon rules home, family, motherhood, and childbirth. Whereas the planet Mercury rules the analytical, intellectual brain, the Moon rules the entire mind, which receives knowledge and wisdom directly from the universe, the subconscious, and the collective unconscious. She also rules habits and unconscious knowledgeâ€""like knowing how to tie your shoes, drive a car, cruise a cutie without getting busted.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"The Moon gives form to your Sun sign, the way a mother gives form to the spark that becomes her child. You may have a rambunctious Aries Sun, but with a Libra Moon, youâ€™ll warm up that drive and assertiveness with diplomacy, tact, consideration and uncertainty. With a Leo Moon, youâ€™re Xena II! There are 144 Sun-Moon combinationsâ€""whatâ€™s yours? Your Lunar Phase at birth will tell an astrologer a lot about your mission in life, and the lunar nodesâ€""a lot more, even, according to Indian astrologers, your true life path.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"Although women as a rule seem much more in touch with lunar energy than men do, still, Western Civilization keeps trying to steer us away from the irrational, illogical, deep and ancient wisdom of lunar energy, and toward rationality, logic, ""common sense"", clock time, schedules, facts and figures. In fact, Don Miguel Ruiz, author of the highly recommended ""The Four Agreements"", calls modern urban humans ""domesticated"". Which means tamed, intimidated, dumbed down, uptight, cut off from our instinctual, lunar selves. To be truly joyful and connected, we need the freedom to honor our instinctive, lunar identity, which in fact is a big part of our overall personality! Learning your Moon sign, natal Lunar Phase, and sign and house placement of your lunar nodes, is a first step toward better self-understanding.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"For those who follow the paths of Wicca, Tibetan Buddhism, and so many other spiritual practices, following the phases of the Moon, and celebrating the New and Full Moons every month, are an important part of worship. Honoring the new and full moons monthly, even with a single white candle, can help to reconnect you when youâ€™re feeling lonely, cut off, depressed, flat and dull, or trapped in a boring job, a frustrating relationship, an environment that doesnâ€™t bring you happiness. If you donâ€™t have one, find a picture that you love of any one of the great Goddesses of any world religion, from Virgin Mary to Kali to Kwan Yinâ€""or even mix and match!â€""make a tiny little shrine to the Goddess on your bookshelf or window sill, and start watching the moon phasesâ€""with a calendar, the newspaper, or one of the many online resources that track the phases, such as Lunabar.com. Light that candle twice a month on the new and full moons, light some great incense, ring a bell, give her a brownie or a glass of vodka, and ask Her for guidance, wisdom, love, health, and luck. Connect with her during your period, too. Chanting, drumming, dancing, singing, playing music, making freeform artwork, playing games, meditating, casting spells, working with Tarot, I Ching or runes or other non-linear spirit work can help forge a link back to your lunar self, and back to wholeness and happiness.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"The New Moon in March is the 14thâ€""the Full Moon is on the 28th. The New Moon is a great time to start a new project. The Full Moon is a time to reap, and a time to wrap up loose ends.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,# # #,0,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"Since March brings the spring equinox and the Sun moves into the Cardinal sign of Aries, Iâ€™ll give you a quick thumbprint of Moon in Aries: Restless, impatient, quick, fiery, assertive, a natural leaderâ€""Aries Moon likes to be numero uno. Even women with Aries Moon are male chauvinists! Theyâ€™ve always got one eye on the future and hate to wait in line, and slowpokes drive them nuts. They want to be independent, free to come and go at will, and they want to do things their own way. They like speed and efficiency. Their leadership style is ""you can follow me or not-but Iâ€™m gonna be out there in front!"" A lot of folks with Aries Moon will tell you they had horrible fights at home, especially with dad. They tend to drive too fast, even though their skills and coordination are usually excellent. A partner with Aries Moon needs a long leash. Unless the Moon is cooled off by a tough aspect from planets such as Saturn or Neptune, you need action, speed, and lots of good lovinâ€™.",1,10

html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"Youâ€™ll experience your Solar Return on or near your birthday, the time when the transiting Sun comes home to the exact place of your natal Sun, setting the tone and theme for the coming year. The first three weeks of the month may find you feeling like you want to check in to a nice quiet convent or ashram or rehab joint somewhere, spend some down time meditating and retreating from all the craziness. This is a great time to clean up some old loose ends, spend time at the hot springs, a yoga or meditation weekend, hit that 12-step program a little harder, stay out of the bars and off the X, and put in time at the library, university, hospital, prison (hopefully as a volunteer!), or whatever other institution you might be linked to. With the Pisces Sun transiting through your 12th House of Self-Undoing, keep your nose clean nowâ€""figure out in what way you are your own worst enemy, and stifle that behaviorâ€""for a while anyway.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"On March 20thâ€""sistah!--break out the champagneâ€""the Sunâ€™s crossed over into your first house and the sign of Aries, itâ€™s the spring Equinox, full speed ahead for you rams and lambs, and the Sunâ€™ll be hooking up with Venus, putting an extra bounce in your step and zapping up your love life. Mars through your 2nd house may bring financial opportunities beginning the 7th. On the 1st, it may be a good time to buy property or new furniture to spruce up the love shack. Itâ€™s also an especially good month for group activities with your sewing circle or biker club or drumming gang.",1,10

html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"The Sunâ€™s in your solar 11th house until the 20th.

Follow that dream, tooâ€""focus on some of your big life goals, both the possible and the impossible ones. Like they say, write it down, make it happen. If youâ€™re in business for yourself, this may be an ""up"" period for your balance sheet. This is a great time to bring in new people into your circle, make new friends, making your goals public.",1,10
html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"On March 20th, when the Sun moves into your solar 12th, things will tend to quiet down for you. Do some spring cleaning, paint the kitchen, pay off your credit card, do a cleanse, get off your Taurus ""tochas"" and go for a hike or a weekend bike ride. Spend some down time with a few close friends, a lover, a cat, or yourselfâ€""get off your earth-bound trip for a while, light some incense, get a tarot reading, have a massage, go hang gliding, or just a nice hot bath with some bath salts and candles and wine. Educational action is good this month. You may get some added responsibilities at work this month, or find you need to tighten your purse strings a little bit. There may be health worries with a parent, or maybe some confusion or delusions or general weirdness at work. The full moon on the 28th may make everybody a little edgy; donâ€™t forget your Full Moon ceremony!",1,10

html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"Emphasis on career this month, boss-type people, maybe even good old Mom. This is a great time to put some extra shine on things at work; Venus in your solar 10th will give you some nice opportunity to mix business with pleasure, too! You might feel inspired artistically, musically, or moved to volunteer some time at the local childrenâ€™s hospital, or to help a friend move (if youâ€™re REALLY a saint!). The pagan festival of Ostara occurs on March 21st, the spring Equinox, which coincides roughly with Easterâ€""a little spring fling is definitely called for. You might be a little more serious and hard-working this month, not quite your usual Gemini motormouth self. Careful who you slip off with for a night of joy this monthâ€""your emotions arenâ€™t as reliable as usual. And there might be a real strong urge to do some spring cleaning around relationships, especially on the 22nd.",1,10

html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"Pisces Sun in your solar 9th house this month puts the spotlight on travel, higher education (including online study), publishing, spiritualityâ€""and horses (for all you pony girls and boys)! On the 20th, the emphasis shifts to your career, your reputation, and your status (including new committed relationships). You might push for more money and recognition now, and spend time with Momâ€""if that relationship is rocky, this might be a time to take steps toward healing. You might feel inspired to get actively involved in political or social activism this monthâ€""but donâ€™t be SO enthusiastic that you turn everybody else off! You might tend to weight gain this month so lay off the Oreos. The stars might nudge you toward some real electric sex this month, and it also might be a time for you to finally decide to dump that nowhere job and reach for something more satisfying.",1,10

html body text center table tbody tr th p span  ,"The first three weeks of the month may be a good time to think about financial security, to take a look at debts, taxes, mortgages, and your and your partnerâ€™s shared resources. If youâ€™re thinking of getting counseling for any reason, during this period you may have easier access to your dreams and your subconscious mindâ€""all that buried STUFF that needs to get thrown out. Clean out closets, basements, attics. You may get financial or other support from people who want to help out. Long-distance travel, continuing ed, or working with exotic types may happen for you now. After the 20th, you may feel a new energetic push at work in your career.

You may feel a real drive to fix up the apartmentâ€""new paint, new pix on the wallâ€""or maybe something even more ambitiousâ€""tearing out a wall and putting in new linoleum in the kitchen. Toward the 20th of the month start taking a look at your investments, taxes (you may have filed an extension), how the two of you manage your joint bank account or household budget, or if youâ€™re in business together, getting that start-up loan or seed money from a backer.
