They suffer more from nearly every medical disease and ailment that there is.And yet, far more money is spent by governments on women's health than on men'shealth. Men are also nowadays educationally disadvantaged significantly compared towomen; with the curriculum, the teaching methods and the resources beingdesigned to cater far more for women and girls than for men and boys.

Men also pay much more in taxes than women but receive farless in benefits from the government.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p b font span  ,"In other words, when compared to women, men aresignificantly disadvantaged when it comes to their health, their homes, theirchildren, their education, their families, the tax burden, the law, the benefitsystem, and even when it comes to theirown personalsafety.",1,11

And it explains why there is nothing sinister about this, for the figures simply demonstrate the consequences of women's biology and the choices that they make.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"Here we look at the ridiculous, distorted propaganda propounded by the EOC, squeezed out from the very same figures.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"The EOC is currently trumpeting the fact that men, on average, earn quarter of a million pounds more than women during the course of their lifetimes, and that, therefore, this reveals some terrible injustice being done to women.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"So, let's look at what this figure really means.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"Firstly, it means that men pay about �90,000 more in taxes than do women. In other words, the average man puts �90,000 more into the pot than does an average women. Your average man is therefore supporting women to the tune of �90,000. Just one average man!",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"Bearing in mind also, that when it comes to benefits, such as health, pensions and income support, a whopping 70% of the budget is actually spent on women's needs, it is absolutely clear that the support, in the UK, given by men to women, is phenomenal, and it shows just how much the men in the UK truly hand over to women via the government coffers.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"Further, men also hand money over directly to women when they stay at home to look after the kids. And why shouldn't they stay at home to look after the kids if that's what the pair of them want? Why should feminists try to make women go out and earn the same as their partners?",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"So, what do the feminazis at the EOC do with these figures? Well, as usual, they twist their real meanings and turn them into man-hating propaganda.

html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"Imagine that the figures were the other way round.

html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"""Women are having to do all the work. Women pay more taxes than men. The tax laws are discriminatory because they take more from women."" And do you know what would happen next? There would be a major government initiative to stop benefits for men, and demand that they take up any work that was on offer. The government would set different tax rates for men and women in order to make sure that men could not benefit from 'sex-discriminatory' tax laws.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"But the EOC figures show that UK men put hell of a lot more into the pot, and they take hell of a lot less out of it. And it is still the case that while men die seven years earlier than women, they are still expected to work for five more years before receiving their pensions.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"This is going to change in the future, thanks to Brussels and the European Commission. But do notice that, working for five years longer and receiving seven years less of pension, adds up to a massive twelve years of financial injustice. A truly blatant, ongoing act of sex discrimination. An enormous act of discrimination. And what has the EOC done about this? Nothing. Nothing at all.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font b span  ,"People really must take on board the fact that the EOC is a feminist organisation dominated by all the selfish, self-centred slogans of feminism.
