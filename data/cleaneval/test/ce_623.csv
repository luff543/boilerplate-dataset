html body text blockquote p b font font span  ,"The following unit provides5 detailed learning experiences and a list of additional activities thatexplore the life cycle and habitat of a variety of penguins. This unitwas designed for second grade but can be easily modified for any elementarylevel class. The unit took approximately 5 to 6 weeks to cover. Althoughall areas of the curriculum were involved, the focus was on math, scienceand technology. The culmination of this unit was a special ""Penguin Program"".Parents and special guests were invited to see a production, which involvedsongs, poems, a reader�s theater and a geography presentation involvingBeanie Babies. I then presented a Power Point Program which allowed theguests to see an outline of the unit and pictures of the various activitiesand experiments that the students had taken part in.",1,9
