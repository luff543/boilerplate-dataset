html body text div div div div div div span  ,"A completely law-related post today. For the non-lawyers, if you want to read on, the whole point of the following is that no government department is an entity capable of suing or being sued. If you want to sue a Queensland government department, then you sue ""The State of Queensland"" or you sue the chief executive of that department - usually, it's the first.",1,10

html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"COMMISSIONER: Thank you, Mr Boddice, for those very helpful submissions. I personally have no difficulty with the proposition which you advance as to why Queensland Health has an interest in this matter or the criteria which should be taken into account in granting or refusing leave. My difficulty at the moment is in understanding precisely who or what it is that you will be representing. I take it from what you have said so far that you are not proposing to represent all of the staff of Queensland Health?",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"MR BODDICE: Yes, except to the extent of it causes a conflict or they seek separate representation.",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,COMMISSIONER: Then how do we know which of the staff you are representing and which you are not?,1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"MR BODDICE: Because, as I understand the system that applies, staff who seek representation make application to the Attorney's Department, a division of it, and a decision is made as to whether to grant indemnity or not. If they are granted indemnity, I represent those people. If it is of concern to the Commission I can indicate at each time whether I represented that person or not.",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"COMMISSIONER: I think the difficulty arises at an earlier stage, though, whether - counsel, consisting of investigative staff, going out and interviewing people, how do we know in advance whether it is a client of yours or not? For example, our first witness today is going to be Ms Hoffman. At the stage when we were interviewing Ms Hoffman, how were we to know whether you were going to be appearing for her or not? I assume you are not, by the way?",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"MR BODDICE: Not that I am aware, no. I don't understand she has sought leave - I don't understand she has sought representation.",1,11

html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"COMMISSIONER: Well, isn't there a potential conflict there? Isn't it a situation where ultimately this inquiry will have to determine if there are problems within the department, whether it is a situation where the Minister was informed of the problem and did nothing about them, or whether it is a situation where the department withheld relevant information from the Minister?",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"MR BODDICE: No, because in my submission I am there representing the department, and as has been stated in public and I state publicly now, Queensland Health intends to cooperate fully, and all documents that have been asked forhave been provided and will be continued to be provided.",1,11

html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"COMMISSIONER: And that's where I have difficulty in understanding where you draw the line. If you speak about it as an organisation, that presumably means all of its staff, and you will be protecting the interests of all of its staff. If it is something less than that, I would like to know what it is, whether it is only the Director-General, whether it is the Director-General and its deputies. You refer to the Fitzgerald Inquiry. My recollection was Mr Callanan was given leave to appear for the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners of the Queensland Police Service, or natural persons, rather than the Police Service as an entity. That may be mistaken.",1,11

They obviously will represent a great number of people who are members of the staff of the department that you are purporting to speak for, the AMA Queensland will be seeking leave to appear. They obviously represent quite a number of the people that you are purporting to speak for. I just can't see practically how you can say, ""I appear for the department"", without identifying in what sense you appear for the department.",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,MR BODDICE: That must be the difficulty that confronted the Fitzgerald Inquiry.,1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"COMMISSIONER: Well, perhaps the decision was wrong or perhaps the circumstances were so different that it didn't matter, but in this case, given the structure of Queensland Health, the zones and regions, and so on, before giving leave I would like to know quite specifically whose interests you are representing. If it were, for example, the council or the committee operating Bundaberg Hospital, they might have quite different views about the matters arising here from the Director-General or other staff in Charlotte Street.",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,MR BODDICE: Yes.,1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"COMMISSIONER: Again, I can't see how you can possibly get around the conflict of interest that arises from representing on the one hand the interests of the bureaucrats in Charlotte Street, and on the other hand representing the interests of people who are operating the hospital on the ground in Bundaberg.",1,11
html body text div div div div div div i span  ,"MR BODDICE: That, with respect, assumes there is a conflict in those interests.",1,11
