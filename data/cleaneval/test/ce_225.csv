The robots are grouped into tribes according to the numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different number of arms to the other members.

In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe.
