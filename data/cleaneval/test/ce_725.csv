html body text div div blockquote p span  ,"The Deppeller family (Don Deppeller, Toni Jannelli and Louise White) had made claims that they had been harassed and kept under surveillance because of their awareness of highly-classified US gov’t. projects, and in a remarkable turn of events, their claims were actually corroborated by one of America’s top scientists who worked on these projects. – one Dr. Dan Burisch, Phd., H-6196-Maj-E-(ret.), who admitted to certain facts that have been withheld from the public for over fifty years.",1,8

html body text div div p span  ,"I bought a bunch of new stuff from iTunes recently, and have set up a playlist for songs added in the last 30 days, which the Party Shuffle feature has been dealing from for the past week or so, with a few other songs mized in here and there. I thought I'd offer a slightly more serious pop-culture thread by highlighting some of the tracks that are in particularly heavy rotation in Chateau Steelypips at the moment.",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"I'd provide MP3's of these tracks, but I don't want to get sued. Anyway, they're all available from iTunes at a buck apiece, even if you're not likely to find them in your local record store.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""Tiny Spark,"" by Brendan Benson",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"a chugging guitar riff, heavy layers of synthesizers, and rich harmonies (or at least lots of overdubs) on the vocals. Power-pop gold. The rest of the album (",1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Lapalco,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,") is pretty solid, too.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""Soft Machine"" by By Divine Right.",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"Not only is it a dumb band name, they win the Hoppus/ DeLong Award for Most Juvenile Lyric of the Year (""I got a non-dairy creamer in my jeans, I'm happy to see you if you know what I mean."" Yes. We know",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,exactly,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"what you mean. Please stop.). Still, it's a ridiculously catchy little fuzzed-out pop song. If the Eels decided to play to the frat-boy demographic, this is what it would sound like.",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"The album is pretty uneven, and I only bought a handful of tracks. ""The Slap"" and ""I Can't Do This by Myself"" are good, too.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""Just to See You Smile,"" by Chuck Prophet",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,". I only bought one track off this one, but this song has been in heavy rotation on the ""Adult Alternative"" channel of our digital cable for a good year and a half now. A sweet and dopey little song, with the riff behind the chorus lifted from ""Penny Lane."" (Not really, but that's what it reminds me of.)",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""Catch My Disease,"" by Ben Lee",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,". This one's been getting some radio airplay-- a silly little toy piano line, nonsensical lyrics, and a great pleading chorus. Weirdly, my brain has decided that this is what the band fronted by Dominic Monaghan's character on",1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Lost,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"would sound like. The rest of the album, not so much, but this song, yes.",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,The other highlight from the record (,1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Awake is the New Sleep,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,", which is pretty good all around) is ""Into the Dark,"" which sounds just like ""Hey, Julie"" by Fountains of Wayne, only with an Aussie accent.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""White Russian Galaxy,"" by the Crimea",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,". Another power-pop gem. I have no idea what it's about, but it's hard not to sing along with the chorus. The album (",1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Lottery Winners on Acid,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"-- more of an EP really) is kind of uneven (there's one song with really dreadful Streets-style spoken-word verses), but it's cheap.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""The Bucket,"" by Kings of Leon",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,". OK, this isn't all that obscure, as it's the first radio single from their new record (",1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Aha Shake Heartbreak,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"), but I like it a lot. I can't understand a word the lead singer is saying, but it's a great tune. Imagine the best 70's era classic rock song in the world being played on the other side of a foot-thick concrete wall, and you've got the basic idea.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""Lockjaw,"" by the Rugburns",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,. This is available from iTunes as part of a different album than the one I have (,1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Taking the World by Donkey,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,", which was a gift from my sister). This is a deeply frustrating band. About half of the tracks are so ridiculously sophomoric that they make Blink-182 look like Bob Dylan, so it'd be tempting to dismiss them as just crap. But mixed in with the terrible songs are some really excellent little pop songs. This is the best of the lot-- a sweet little song about a guy who can't talk to the girl he likes.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""It Makes No Difference,"" by Solomon Burke",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,". This is a cover of a song by The Band. There aren't a lot of people who can match Levon Helm's voice for desperate pleading, but Burke does a good job of it. It's off his follow-up to",1,7
html body text div div p a cite span  ,Don't Give Up on Me,1,9
html body text div div p span  ,", which is pretty good on the whole, and not as uneven as the previous record.",1,7
html body text div div p strong span  ,"""Pickin' It Up,"" by Hot Hot Heat",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,". Their last record had a couple of really good songs and some undistinguished crap, but this one (",1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Elevator,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,") is much more solid. If the Strokes gave a damn, they might sound this good.",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,The other two albums I bought were the new Springsteen (,1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Devils and Dust,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,) and the new Al Green (,1,7
html body text div div p cite span  ,Everything's OK,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"). Both are very good, but I haven't listened to them carefully enough to really pull out single tracks (the song that cries out to be picked is Green's take on ""You Are So Beautiful,"" but that's not really representative, and while he does a nice job with it, it's still schmaltz). I may or may not have more to say about them later.",1,7

html body text div div p span  ,"First, I occasionally post huge long articles about fiddly little details of physics things, and it seems impolite to inflict that on people reading via RSS aggregators, in the same way that it's sort of impolite to put gigantic image files directly on the front page.
