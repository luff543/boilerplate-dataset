html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Eighteen year old Alan Webb, a senior at South Lakes High School from Reston, Virginia, ran a 3:53.43 mile to break Jim Ryan's 36 year old national high school record (3:55.3), once thought to be untouchable.",1,22
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"How good of race was it? He basically stole the show from the best track athletes in the world. World record holder, Hichem El Guerrouj (pronounced ""Heeshum El Garoosh"") ran the first sub-3:50 mile ever on American soil, which amazingly, played second fiddle to the kid four spots behind him. El Guerrouj even downplayed his own acheivement. Instead, he joined the rest of the appreciative Hayward Field crowd celebrating the high-schooler's accomplishment, raising the young runner's arm and presenting him to the south bleacher fans. In this reporter's opinion, it was one of the most selfless and class gestures I have ever seen in any competitive sport. El Guerrouj said the young runner could very well become his chief rival. Wow.",1,22
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Webb came to the Pre Classic under what otherwise would have been smothering expectations for anyone his age, coming off of a sub-4:00 indoor mile…another national high school record. He smiled his way right through all of the pressure. When asked by El Guerrouj if he wanted to run 3:55 in a hotel lobby meeting a few days before, ""Hell, yeah!"" was his response.",1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Before the race, he looked relaxed and loose as he warmed up, seeming to savor the atmosphere in the House That Pre Built. I yelled to him ""Go, Alan!"" from my third row seat, and he looked over and gave me a smile and a nod. After the race, he shook every hand extended to him, looked everyone straight in the eye and flashed what will undoubtedly soon become a very famous smile on the world stage.",1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"For Pre Classic veterens, Race Director, Tom Jordan summed up the race perfectly: ""In terms of thrills for one race, this has to be the greatest in Pre Classic history."" No one would have predicted that Jim Ryan's record would be broken; not his coach, not Alan Webb.",1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,Even the news media was not speculating on the possibility.,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"After a torrid first lap, he was running last. Unlike one television commentator who suggested the possibility of a last place finish, the trained eyes of his coach and the knowledgeable Hayward Field crowd recognized the discipline in Webb's opening lap, resisting the temptation to go out with the leaders…and the rabbits who went out way too fast. ""Smart kid,"" his coach and about 10,000 others were thinking at about that time. His split was at 58 seconds. Right where his coach wanted him. He reached the halfway point at 1:57 and looked in control, now having moved up a couple of spots. On the third lap, he continued to run smart, as El Guerrouj, looking like he was not even working, continued to widen his lead.",1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Then, Webb went to work, while this reporter went to sleep (e.g. I confess I was focusing on the guy about to break 3:50 for the first time on American soil). From where I was, I couldn't see history in the making across the track as Webb started his surge. He began his 55 second last lap by immediately moving into lane two on turn seven and passing a couple of runners. On the back stretch, he passed a couple of other surprised runners and one even more surprised 10K Truth photographer, who was busy snapping shots of El Guerrouj. On the last turn, he continued to pick off runners, finishing in an amazing 5th place, even wishing he'd held on to fourth. ""I can run with these people. I was passing as many people as I could. I didn't know who I was passing, I just wanted to try to catch as many as I could. Now, I want to beat some of these people."" Remember that the person talking here is in high school?",1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"""I ran pretty fast. Today was a very good day, and I'm glad to have done it on Hayward Field. This means everything to me. I did it on the track where Pre ran. He was my hero."" No chest pounding. No strutting around the track high-fiving anyone in sight. In fact, on his way around the track, he had the presence of mind to maintain his respect for the other athletes, yielding to competitors in the pole vault and the start of the women's 200 meters. Is that any good, or what?",1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"""He don't look like no high school dude,"" said Maurice Green. No kidding.",1,18
