html body text div span span  ,In Which I Am Mildly Reprobate,1,6
html body text div p span  ,"A decade or so ago, when I left college and moved into my first apartment, I remember being cranky about the way our society was organized, because this is the sort of thing one does at age twenty. ""Why don't people give me dishes and small appliances now, when I could use them?"" I demanded. ""Why should I wait until I get married? What if I never get married? What if I don't",1,6
html body text div p i span  ,want,1,7
html body text div p span  ,"to get married? And why should I have to find a compatible mate in order to convince my family to shell out four hundred bucks on the deluxe KitchenAid stand mixer a grateful world should rightfully have given me by now?"" (Alert readers will recognize this as a culinarily obsessed variation on Calvin's famous query: ""Why isn't [the world] ever unfair in my favor?""*)",1,6
html body text div p span  ,"Now I am older, and wiser, and while I still think it a bit ridiculous that finding the love of my life is to be rewarded with blenders (standard and hand), I concede that the crystal was fun to pick out and the sheet sets will come in extremely handy. So will the Talmud. Oh, yes, we",1,6
html body text div p i span  ,did,1,7
html body text div p span  ,"-- we selected an online Judaica store with nice discounts on Schottenstein Talmud volumes and methodically registered for every last one we do not own (except the ones for which we registered at our local-but-sadly-Internet-free Judaica store). The results are truly fascinating. The registry displays in reverse-alphabetical order, which led me to worry that we would wind up with Zevachim and nothing else, but it turns out that our friends and family know what they are doing. For instance, the cousin who always comes to our Seders bought us Pesachim (three volumes). A friend whose research has focused heavily on related topics bought us Ta'anit (or, as Artscroll would have it, Ta'anis). There's just a lot more you can say with a volume of Talmud than with a blender, even a tangerine-colored one.",1,6
html body text div p span  ,"Looking at our registry online -- something I do a little more often than I care to admit -- I can tell that people have also already bought us Shabbat, Bava Metzia, and Avodah Zarah, but we have not received the books or the accompanying identification of their senders, so we feel free to speculate. Bava Metzia is easy -- someone wants us to start Talmud in the traditional way -- and Shabbat is certainly a good general-purpose tractate, plus it has a decent shot at being the next thing the UCSJ's Mishnah Yomit program takes on,** and more than one person in our circle might suspect we could stand to study it. But I'm dying to know whether the person who bought us Avodah Zarah saw our",1,6

html body text div p span  ,", or whether it's someone joking about my deep and personal interest in Jewish-Christian relations, or what. Mind you, I am also excited about finally getting my KitchenAid Professional 6 in meringue white -- especially since Talmud does not come with an ice-cream maker attachment -- but then again the KitchenAid does not come with Tosafot.",1,6
html body text div p span  ,"Really, I feel that I should apologize to my younger and more idealistic self for all this complacency. I am perilously close to viewing wedding gifts not only as evidence that various family and friends wish us well in married life, but also as reasonable recompense from a marginally just universe*** for having had to live with a wedding-related to-do list for the past six months. While I stand by my original assertion that planning a smallish wedding is not so very difficult -- not if both parties have a decent network of friends, are reasonably competent at returning phone calls, and avoid being more than half a mile from a wireless Internet connection at all times -- I cannot help thinking it would have been easier if we had both been left on orphanage doorsteps somewhat earlier in life, or at least if we were not both the sorts of people to whom our families feel free to make quite so many helpful suggestions.****",1,6

html body text div p i span  ,was,1,7
html body text div p span  ,"a helpful suggestion -- or, rather, offer), but it has been a busy six months since we got engaged, and the amazing social superpowers of Planning A Wedding (bore your friends! distract your colleagues! excuse yourself from anything!) do not quite compensate for the hours of research I have had to put into things which never floated my boat in the first place. I would infinitely rather study animal sacrifices than men's formal wear, and this despite the fact that I would be the one bringing two Tofurkeys to the altar in the unlikely event of a Third Temple.",1,6

We are getting married (I am in fact still deliriously happy about that part), and people are coming to dance with us, and since I have nothing better to do this month besides learn the Torah I'm reading for the aufruf, I think I am planning a Tikkun Leil Shavuot. And as soon as I have sorted out what I am doing with the rest of my life (because this is the sort of thing one does at age nearly-thirty), I will keep everyone on Baraita updated.
