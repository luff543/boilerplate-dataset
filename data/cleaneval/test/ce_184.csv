html body text span  ,"For a rookie outing, Screen really isn't too bad. That is, of course, ifit's really a rookie outing. In the comp you can never really be surethat anything is what it appears to be, and for all I know ""EdwardFloren"" is a pseudonym for somebody who's released a half-dozen games.But I don't think so.

For another thing, there's the fact that althoughthere are plenty of scenery objects (and I know this because typing GETALL listed them out -- another rookie mistake), many of them aren'timplemented at all. It doesn't take very many ""You see nothing specialabout the",1,4
html body text span whatever  ,""" messages for immersion to fall by the wayside. Onthe other hand, some other aspects of the game are coded rather nicely,such as the custom cant_go messages and the room descriptions thatchange depending on whether you're seeing the room for the first time ornot.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The prose quality is a similarly mixed bag. Much of the writingsuccessfully evokes a sweet nostalgia as it depicts Jordan the PC'sreturn to the scene of his childhood games. Riffs on Baby Boomer popculture are handled lovingly, with a light enough touch to let them feeltouching without being cloying. On the down side, this game woulddefinitely have benefited from another round of proofreading. Considerthe flashback to Jordan's first kiss, where he stares at the girl helikes and the narrator tells us, ""She looked so sweat."" This is one ofthe worst sorts of English errors to have in the public release of yourgame -- not only does it miss its intended meaning, but in fact itsquarely hits another meaning entirely, and a rather comical one atthat. Certainly it's an understandable error -- it's only one letter offthe correct spelling, and could even be a typo, and for that matter""neat"" and ""beat"" have the intended phoneme. Then again, the word""sweating"" is used only three sentences later, which makes the error alittle less understandable. In any case, it's a bad, bad mistake thatentirely punctures the otherwise poignant scene. And lest it seem thatI'm pouncing on the whole game for one little mistake, I hasten to addthat little errors like this (though none worse than that) are presentthroughout the game, and should have been eliminated before its release.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The prose errors didn't stop me from enjoying the game overall, though.For the most part, it's a short and sweet little romp through childhoodmemories and favorite TV shows. The puzzles, too, are mostlystraightforward, though I was unfortunate enough to trip repeatedly on arather tightly timed puzzle towards the game's end. The problem therewas that although I had figured out the elements of the puzzle, thesolution required an extra step that, as near as I can tell, wascompletely unclued. Dear me, every time I start to praise this game Iend up criticizing it. Overall, Screen is a nicely sketched vignette.Even if it feels rather aimless and disjointed at times (man, there I goagain!), I didn't want my 45 minutes back after I finished it. It's anice start at the IF craft, and I look forward to the author's nextwork.",1,5

html body text h2 a span  ,A PARTY TO MURDER,1,6
html body text h2 span  ,by David Good,1,5
html body text span  ,I will say this for it: A Party To Murder is the best,1,4
html body text a span  ,ADRIFT,1,5
html body text span  ,"game I'veever played. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. Even if it werewritten in a first-tier IF language, APTM would have some problems toovercome, but as it is, it's hopelessly lumbered by the terrible,terrible ADRIFT parser. We're talking about a mystery game here,reminiscent of",1,4
html body text a span  ,Suspect,1,5
html body text span  ,"-- you play a guest at a party where a murder isdiscovered, and you must extricate yourself from suspicion. A mysterygame, okay? You might think that, in a mystery game, you'd be able toSEARCH things. Not this one -- it doesn't recognize SEARCH, LOOK IN, orLOOK THROUGH. Worse, with the latter two it parses them as LOOK ratherthan just admitting that it doesn't recognize them. Same with LOOK UNDERand LOOK BEHIND. Hint: ignoring prepositions doesn't make them go away,it just makes your response more likely to be wrong. Perhaps, in amystery game, you might want to SHOW things to NPCs. You can't here.Even if you hold a completely damning piece of evidence and want to showit to the person whom it damns, all you get from the ADRIFT parser is ""Idon't understand what you want me to do with the letter."" Maybe, in amystery game, you might even want to TELL someone about something. Inthis game, you can't. All these very basic verbs, absolutely standardwith any first-tier system, are unavailable in ADRIFT, and their absenceabsolutely slaughters this game. In fact, from a very early stage,whenever I encountered one of the game's many containers, I got in thehabit of trying to GET ALL FROM it, because that was the only reliableway I could get the game to tell me whether there was anything inside.Needless to say, I wasn't exactly feeling immersed in the story whiledoing so.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"As I said above, even if all these problems were resolved, APTM stillwouldn't be a great game. Part of the reason for this is the fact thatthe game seems to operate on its own inscrutable logic rather than anysort of recognizable sense of cause-and-effect. For instance, there's aportion of the game where access to a useful item is being controlled byone of the NPCs. The only way to persuade this NPC to let you have theobject is to perform a long series of apparently arbitrary tasks, andthe NPC doesn't really indicate that it wants these tasks performed. Theonly way I found out was via the walkthrough, and I'd be surprised ifanybody figured it out any other way. Of course, by that time I wasgoing straight from the walkthrough anyway, because in my initialplaythrough of the game, I never found that NPC at all -- it seems sheonly appears after a particular item has been discovered, even thoughthat item is more or less unrelated to her absence. Oh, and that item isonly accessible by using an object whose primary logical use isunimplemented in the game. For the sake of spoilers, I won't name whatthat object is, but just for example, if you found a knife, and the gamedidn't understand the word CUT, you might think that knife was a redherring (and that the game was lazily implemented). Wouldn't you besurprised to find out from the walkthrough that even though CUT isn'timplemented, you still need the knife to, oh I don't know, scrape themud off a stone tablet or something? Something analogous occurs in thisgame. See what I mean about inscrutable logic? In addition to logicproblems, there are certain implementation errors as well. For example,most of the game consists of a flashback, but typing X ME while still inthe frame story depicts the PC as if the flashback was alreadyhappening.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"So after all this, what makes APTM the best ADRIFT game I've everplayed? Well, for one thing, despite the occasional glitch, it does havea decent depth of implementation. Most first-level nouns are described,and the setting is rather richly detailed. I spent an inordinate numberof hours with Suspect when I was younger, and at times this game broughtback pleasant memories of that experience. The writing gets its job donewith a minimum of errors, and the NPCs are coded to handle a reasonablenumber of inquiries. In fact, a couple of times during the game I askedan NPC about a somewhat extraneous topic, and was happily surprised todiscover that the response had been implemented. Another point in favorof the NPCs is that they will sometimes react sensibly to strangeactions on the player's part; for instance, walking into the teenagedaughter's bedroom while she's making out with the neighbor elicitsangry responses from both of them, escalating in intensity the longerthe PC hangs around. Snooping around the objects in the house, thoughit's necessary, also provokes suspicion from some of the NPCs. Thenagain, nobody gives you a second glance when you walk through the housecarrying an 8-foot ladder, so this realistic implementation is reallyrather patchy. Overall, APTM would be a seaworthy craft, but between thelogic holes in its hull and the tsunamis of ADRIFT inadequacy, it sinksdismally fast.",1,5

html body text h2 a span  ,RAMON AND JONATHAN,1,6
html body text h2 span  ,by Daniele A. Gewurz,1,5
html body text span  ,"Since classical times, stories have opened ""in medias res."" This phrase,Latin for ""in the middle of things"", refers to a narrative that beginsduring some crucial piece of action, filling in the background and thepreceding events sometime later. Ramon and Jonathan fulfills the formerpart of this bargain, but never the latter. The game drops us into somesort of science-fictional scenario where some (maybe) criminals arebeing exonerated, or extradited, or something, and suggests that we'renot happy with the situation. Then there's an unintuitive door-openingpuzzle, a bit of quick noun-guessing with an NPC, and then it's over. Wenever learn the backstory behind who did what to whom and why, who liveson what planet and how they got there, or who any of these characterseven are. Because the first (and really only) puzzle didn't make anysense to me, I turned to the walkthrough in record time, but even afterI had walked through the game, I still didn't really get it. As I alwayssay in these situations, that may be because I'm dense, but egomaniacthat I am, I'm more inclined to believe that the game did aninsufficient job of explaining itself.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Not helping matters was the fact that the prose is written in not-quite-fluentEnglish. It's not terrible, mind you -- many of the sentencespass muster without a problem, but those that don't are really jarring.For instance:",1,5
html body text pre span  ,">x people The audience has been waiting for years this moment, and is mostly greatly disappointed for the two ""hangmen"" to have been virtually cleared. Everybody rumble and yell.",1,5

html body text span  ,"up to snuff, if only ""years"" and ""for""exchanged places -- it would still sound awkward and clunky after that,but would at least be grammatically correct. The second sentence soundsstereotypically, almost laughably wrong, as if it were written for aBronson Pinchot character. You know, I've said this before: I don't carewhether English is your first language or not, but I do care aboutfluency and readability. If you can't write fluent English, either don'twrite a text adventure in English or make sure to have your textadventure",1,4

html body text p span  ,"It's also a good idea to fully implement everything you put in yourgame. Ramon And Jonathan, short though it is, is poorly equipped tohandle any deviation from its plotline. Anything outside the bounds ofthe walkthrough is handled in one of two ways. The first method issimply to end the game. This happened to me on my first half-dozenplaythroughs -- either because I walked in a disallowed direction orbecause I failed to solve the timed puzzle, the game abruptly kicked meto the curb and told me to restore or restart. Restarting wasn'tterrible, because I'd invariably just played a few moves anyway, but thefrequency of the situation made it clear that there wasn't much room towander. The other, much worse method that the game uses to handleplayers that leave the path is to simply do nothing. At one point, Iwandered into a room with no less than",1,5

Eventually Ifigured out I must be doing something wrong because my current situationwas so amazingly dull. This does not make for a fun game -- utterboredom shouldn't be the tool that forces players to comply with theplot. So finally, I restarted, hit the walkthrough, made the requiredtwenty moves, and the game ended. Or rather, if an ending implies thateverything has been tied up and some sort of dramatic conclusion hasbeen reached, it's probably more accurate to say the game stopped.",1,5

html body text h2 a span  ,ERIC'S GIFT,1,6
html body text h2 span  ,by Joao Mendes,1,5
html body text span  ,"In the ""about"" text for Eric's Gift, the author mentions that much ofthe inspiration for the story came from a dream. Somehow, this seemsappropriate, because the experience of playing the game was quitereminiscent of a recurring dream of mine: the one where I find myself ina play, but I don't know my character or any of my lines. The otheractors look at me expectantly, waiting for me to say the words that willadvance the plot, and all I can do is madly improvise in a futileattempt to hit on the right topic. Eric's Gift is one of those gamesthat runs on triggers -- examining a particular thing, or asking about aparticular subject, or performing some other action triggers anon-interactive cutscene, which changes the PC's location and moves theplot along. When games like this work, they give the feeling of a storyadvancing smoothly, right in sync with the player's actions. When onebreaks down, though, it's hell -- players flounder about looking for theright action as the plot's momentum evaporates, along with the fun ofthe game. Rather than guess-the-verb or guess-the-noun, the whole thingbecomes a game of guess-the-trigger, which is worse than either one,since it encompasses both verbs and nouns, but you can never be surewhich you're trying to guess at any given moment. That's just whathappened to me in Eric's Gift. I was in a conversation scene where,unbeknownst to me, I needed to examine a sub-object of an object (thatis to say, a second-level noun) in order to trigger the next scene.Thinking I'd examined everything, and having tried to leave, or dovarious other more or less appropriate actions, I kept fishing for newthings to ask about, feeling like one of those characters in",1,4
html body text a span  ,Sartre's NoExit,1,5
html body text span  ,", doomed to spend all eternity trapped with the same annoyingperson.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"In a situation like this, it really helps a lot if the game isthoroughly implemented, and in part, Eric's Gift accomplishes this. Allavailable scenery objects are described, and a few off-the-beaten-pathconversation topics are implemented, too. However, as time wore on and Ikept not guessing the trigger, the NPC began to feel more and morethreadbare, always failing to respond to my increasingly desperate topicchoices. Perhaps part of my problem was that I was a bit distracted bythe game's insistent use of the same metaphor over and over and OVERagain. Saying that a woman has a ""light in her eyes"" is already a bit ofa clichÃ©, but quite tolerable if said once, maybe even twice. This gamehits it so often that it becomes comical. My breaking point was when Iencountered this description: ""Her eyes shine with a light of their own,with an intensity that almost blinds you."" Mind you, there had alreadybeen many repetitions of the ""light in the eyes"" theme, but this one wasway, way over the top. How could the light in someone's eyes, which Itake to mean an animated, vivacious expression, almost blind me? Icouldn't help but picture the NPC with high-beam headlights for eyes,the PC shielding his face from the glare. The lesson here is that anygiven metaphor is best used sparingly -- the more often we see it, theless effective it becomes.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"My other issue with Eric's Gift is that it is pointlessly science-fictional.What I mean by that is that although the story is set in thefuture, it gains virtually nothing thereby. A few details are changedhere and there -- people drink ""synthcaf"" instead of coffee, the TV iscalled a ""tri-di"", and so forth -- but otherwise the story might just aswell be set in 2002. Not one significant point of plot or characterderives from the futuristic setting, and consequently that setting islittle more than a distraction. Adding a science-fictional sheen to anotherwise mundane story doesn't somehow make that story cooler. Quitethe contrary, in fact -- it drains the story of mainstream appeal whilegaining nothing in sf credibility. Oh, and one more thing: there areserious logical holes in the plot, especially in the defining element ofthe plot. Although its writing and coding was competent, the logicalflaws, awkward emotion, and frustrating design make Eric's Gift one thatI won't be keeping.",1,5

html body text h2 a span  ,JANE,1,6
html body text h2 span  ,by Joseph Grzesiak,1,5
html body text span  ,"Note: Because strong language and themes of domestic abuse appear inthis game, they will also appear in this review.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"A couple of years ago, I released a",1,5
html body text p a span  ,game with some pretty intensethemes,1,6
html body text p span  ,", including rape, murder, and slavery. Aside from whatever otherways my game succeeded or failed, people's reactions to encounteringthis sort of thing in a work of IF varied a lot. Some people reallyappreciated it, others... not so much. One player rather memorablydescribed it this way: ""After playing, my head felt like someone hadbeen hitting it very hard with a solid metal thing."" After playing thisgame, I understand a little more where that guy was coming from. Janetakes on the topic of wife-beating, portraying it from the perspectiveof the victim, the abuser, and a few others besides. The experience ofplaying through a story in IF form, as opposed to reading it on thepage, really intensifies my identification with the characters, andthere were moments during my time with Jane that I started feelingphysically ill, and dirty, involved in something I did not wish to be apart of. I don't mean to sound disapproving -- those moments were quitepowerful and dramatic, and the game did give a clear warning about itssubject matter before it began. Indeed, the times when I was feeling themost upset were when I was admiring Jane the most; its writing and itsimplementation occasionally managed to affect me quite strongly.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"On the other hand, that effect was only occasional, for several reasons.First of all, though I applaud it for its ambition in getting inside theheads of abuser, victim, and onlookers, the characterization frequentlyfell a bit flat for me. The dialogue and actions of the characterssometimes rang quite true, but other times felt fairly stock, as ifpulled from one of those movies that always seem to be running on the",1,5
html body text p a span  ,Lifetime,1,6
html body text p span  ,"channel. Another, more severe issue is that presenting a storylike this interactively is a major challenge, and the game wasn't alwaysprepared to meet that challenge. At its worst moments, the clash betweenthe intense action of the story and the standard",1,5

You're so fucking useless!"" >push john That would be less than courteous.",1,5
html body text span  ,"Those library messages, quite suitable in the majority of IF situations,are laughably inappropriate here, and either the author or the testersshould have caught them. The debugging verbs should also have beenturned off -- the effect of these things together was that Jane had afairly rushed feel. Even more damaging, by failing to account for fairlyreasonable actions, the game makes itself too vulnerable toridiculousness, which is poison to the kind of tragic storytelling itattempts.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Even when it does properly account for the player's input, though, Janeusually feels quite straitjacketed. In fact, although the game borrowsheavily from Photopia by using multiple perspectives (albeit achronologically intact story) and a virtually identical approach toconversation, it reminded me less of",1,5
html body text p a span  ,Photopia,1,6
html body text p span  ,than of,1,5
html body text p a span  ,Rameses,1,6
html body text p span  ,".Unfortunately, it wasn't the brilliant subversion of IF and storytellingthat Rameses was, both because that game arrived first and because inits very use of multiple viewpoints and linear chronology, Jane dilutesthe best rationale for its linearity. I can see a viable argument thatJane (the NPC, not the game), and perhaps even her abusive husband,should present few real options to the player. They're locked into thecycle of abuse, and the player's frustration could mirror that of thecharacters as they try and fail to break out of their long-establishedpatterns. However, that's far less true for other characters, who lacksuch a reason for being bound to any particular course of action. Inaddition, as the intensity of the rising action builds, the charactersshould have more freedom available, as desperate measures become moreand more plausible. Since I experienced the story in accuratechronological order, I expected that at some point I'd be able to findmy own way out of the ugly tangle of that relationship. Instead, what Ifound was that I had to follow the game's singular path through it, andthat meant enduring just as much abuse as the game decided it ought tocommit. In my own way, I felt a little battered by the time I finished.I did finish, though. I didn't quit. I guess I was asking for it.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"to beconstrained. In each scenario, I struggled for a bit against thecircumstances, but then tried doing things that would indicate a certainpeace with the situation. Each time, I was rebuffed, instructed that thecharacter's desire outweighed whatever notions I might have aboutgraceful acceptance. I'm not complaining about this. It's quitelegitimate to instruct a player about how to behave in character when acharacter is specified, and in a game this skillfully done, I wouldn'tbe at all surprised if the additional level of constraint was quiteintentional. The idea intrigues me, though. How much of what we callconstraints in our lives are simply produced by our own desires, more orless independent of our circumstances? When we feel held down, heldback, would the feeling disappear if we decided that we no longer wantedwhatever lay on the other side of the barrier? For that matter, can aconstraint even exist without a corresponding desire to define it assuch? In this game, the question is moot -- there's no way of changingthe characters' desires -- but I really like it that the experience ofplaying made me think about such a philosophical issue in my own life.",1,5

Even though it was thought-provoking andnicely crafted, in the end I didn't find it terribly enjoyable; I don'treally like being constrained.
