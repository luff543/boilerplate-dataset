However the roller coaster polarity of hard work and personal space, of external pressures and internal joys, of the expectations from the world and the ideals of the band have all culminated in a remarkably well realised second release in Unity.",1,22
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Refusing to ride on the successful formula that saw singles such as Special Ones, Run and Breathe In Now achieve critical acclaim, george have broadened their musical scope. They're exploring different sounds from the introspective, getting back to the acoustic joy of five musicians and then taking the songs where they will - whether it is a simple melody and guitar line or the grandiose splendour of a huge symphonic sound.",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"""I personally feel like I've developed a lot as a songwriter,"" comments Tyrone, ""more confident lyrics and statements being expressed through those lyrics. Overall it's a more positive approach in dealing with personal issues and socio-political issues, more positive light. As a band, this to me feels like a really mature album for us. I feel like the five of us have really connected stronger than ever before musically as a unit.""",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"""The album is a combination of all of the recording practice we'd all done,"" adds Paulie. ""george have always prided themselves on high quality recordings, and individually Unity was my sixth or seventh full length album to record with a band. We were all completely comfortable with who we were for each other, and that was something we really learned on the first record. Polyserena was us learning how to make a record, Unity was making that record.""",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Working hand in hand with producer David Nicholas and assistant Justin Tresidder (additional production and engineering), both of whom also worked on Polyserena, everyone felt a sense of comfort and intimacy during the recording session that occurred in the beautiful surrounds of Byron Bay. Melbourne's revered composer Paul Grabowsky also assisted with sweeping orchestral and horn arrangements, lending the music a dignity that refrained from falling into pretension. Songs like first single Still Real and Today examine people's relationships with their own lives, as well as providing a touching insight into the band themselves.",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"""I think that sense of friendship comes from the early days of george, in that it was about two sets of siblings, so it was about family and love and very close, intense relationships,"" considers Katie. ""That family vibe brings a closeness and honesty that permeates what we do. Collectively and individually, we've been through a great period of change and growth. Knowing we can look to each other for strength brings comfort and solidarity. We have all been through the same thing and there's an incredible sense of union from that experience - that's what being in a band's about.""",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"It's a perspective that has seen this band survive more than seven years now. ""The essence of george was a couple of sets of siblings getting together for the sake of music, and both the Noonan family and Stewart family had musical parents who were very passionate about letting their children find what made them happy and how to achieve what they wanted to achieve in life,"" explains Nick. ""From the very onset, Ty, Katie and myself have had that passion and goal, and that's definitely where Unity comes from. It's a musical search that with complete support from our parents, we've been able to pursue, and it's likewise for Paulie and Geoff. That came very much to the forefront just before we came in to record this album. It signifies that after all the success that Polyserena had, the basic formula was happiness in music, and that's where we come from and where we're going to and what Unity encapsulates. All five of us very strongly feel that way.""",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"That sentiment of strength and focus is apparent throughout the record - despite moments of darkness and questioning, musically the overriding force is that of positivity and seeking out that silver lining. ""It's meant to be universal,"" asserts Katie. ""There's been an extreme amount of emotional intensity in the world over the last two years, but I feel people are now starting to look to each other again. I'm feeling that anyway. We're feeling that uneasy political turbulence, that sadness of seeing our brothers and sisters in war. So I guess it's not meant to be just about unity for us, it's an everyone thing as well.""",1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Unity. It conjures images of persistence, of sunshine, of hope.

We never really wrote music for commercial success - it was like a happy accident and we feel very lucky and blessed, but it was also very unexpected and it changed our lives a lot, individually and collectively. This song's a reflection on that huge period of growth and change that we've been through as a group and how basically we've learned to look to each other for strength and perspective. At the end of the day, what we do is a very simple thing - it's five people playing music purely because they love it.",1,23

Just the need to get away from the stuff that holds you captive in your space in the city or wherever you may be.

No matter what trials and tribulations we all must face, love is stronger than any of these things…with special thanks to the amazing Pinewood Studios/Herb Albert-inspired orchestration from Paul G and the superb playing of the Queensland Orchestra. Part of the inspiration of this song came from listening to lots of my favourite alternative pop records (yes, vinyl!) from the '80s.

When you're an artist it's often hard to make decisions about your art in that sense. It's a bit of a reflection on that and how unfortunate it is that it's sometimes a reality we have to deal with. But it's also meant to be positive and that it's kind of carefree and let go. It's a positive song because we've got through that period. It's fuelled a very happy, uplifting thing in the end.",1,23

I suppose I'm incapable of not feeling things 110 per cent, I'm just not capable of not letting things get to me, and that's in good and bad ways! I think we're all like that; we're all pretty sensitive. It was meant to be a metaphorical kind of thing, like when you've met somebody and you've fallen in love that's just the deepest degree of that emotion possible, and it's a reflection on that - there's been a lot of emotional intensity recently.

While there is a yearning for an end to violence and greed, there is recognition that love is the greatest force on earth and that each day is a gift, no matter how much further we feel we have to go. The original idea came from a simple riff that just wouldn't go away whenever I sat in front of the piano; and even though it has a minor feel, the subtle change to major for the choruses just appeared one day and gave the song the lift I was looking for.",1,23

It's very much about self empowerment and self worth, and empowering in the sense of everyone has so much stuff in their life that if you wanted to let it get you down it could, whatever it is.

It's also just about letting go emotionally and surrendering to everything. I ended up doing the lyrics at sunset, as the sun was setting on the deck. There were birds and everyone sitting around.
