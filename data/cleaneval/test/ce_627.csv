html body text div font p font span  ,"(Question) - Mr President, would the Leader reveal what, if any, plans the Government has for the future of Great South Land's oil and gas exploration lease, SEL 13/98, which covers the eastern half of Tasmania?",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"As the Leader will be aware the Australian Financial Review reported on Friday that SEL 13/98 has just been renewed for a further five years, effectively tying up half of Tasmania for oil and gas exploration to an unlisted company whose chairman has stated that he is inspired by visions.",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"As the conditions of the lease require a reported exploration expenditure of $21 million, and Great South Land is reported to have capital of less than $13 000, how soon can the State Government ensure more effective exploration of lease SEL 13/98?",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"Mr Harriss - That would be on Mr Rattray's property, wouldn't it?",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,Mrs Rattray-Wagner - I will pass that on.,1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,Mr AIRD - I thought you were going to make a land tax comment.,1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"Mr President, I thank the honourable member for his question. The State Government is aware of Pierpont's article in last Friday's, that is 19 November 2004, Australian Financial Review but has no comment to make on the journalist's assessment on how a company is run.",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"From the Government's position, Great South Land Minerals Ltd - GSLM - was granted a special exploration licence for oil and gas exploration over 30 356 square kilometres of mainland Tasmania for five years from 18 May 1999. GSLM applied for an extension of this special exploration licence over a reduced area on 6 May 2004. For the renewal the licence has been reduced to 15 035 square kilometres, approximately 50 per cent of the original area granted.",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"Renewal of exploration licences can be made provided the applicant demonstrates that they have the technical ability to carry out the proposed work program and the funds to undertake the agreed work program. As part of their renewal application, GSLM presented the Government with a letter from GEM Global Yield Fund - GGYF - London, which stated that GGYF had entered into an equity line of credit with GSLM to provide up to �150 million to finance exploration for oil and gas in the Tasmanian basin.",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,"The renewal was granted on the basis that the licensee intends to spend $21.5 million on exploration during the renewal period to define or disprove commercial quantities of oil or gas. As a condition of renewal, GSLM have agreed to meet additional licence conditions that will ensure that the community gets a fair return from allocation of such a large area. These conditions are as follows:",1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,� GLSM has provided a staged expenditure budget of $21.5 million over five years.,1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,� The Government requires GLSM to meet 80 per cent of cumulative expenditure commitment at the end of each year of the licence. Failure to meet this critical condition will result in revocation of the licence.,1,8

html body text div font p font span  ,� Expenses significantly higher than industry standards will not be accepted.,1,8

html body text div font p font span  ,� MRT will be provided with copies of reports or advice from consultants to substantiate such claims.,1,8
html body text div font p font span  ,GSLM shall provide a review of exploration activities to Mineral Resources Tasmania - MRT - on 1 April and 1 October in each year and GSLM shall provide a full interpretation report for the seismic work carried out between January 2001 and June 2001.
