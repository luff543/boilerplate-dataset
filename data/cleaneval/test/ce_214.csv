html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Born and reared in Modesto, California, George Lucas first attracted attention for his filmmaking abilities as a student at the University of Southern California, when his short film, ELECTRONIC LABYRINTH THX 1138 4EB, won the top award at the National Student Film Festival.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In 1971, using San Francisco production studio American Zoetrope and long-time friend Francis Ford Coppola as executive producer, Lucas transformed the short film into his first feature, the stunningly prescient THX 1138.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"His follow-up, the low-budget AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973), became the most successful film of its time. But it was STAR WARS (1977), Lucas' third film, which changed everything. A deceptively simple morality tale of good versus evil told across a fantastic landscape of exotic planets and bizarre creatures, STAR WARS became an international phenomenon. Refusing to accept the limitations of filmmaking at the time, Lucas created his own visual effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, to make his vision a reality.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Lucas has been storywriter and executive producer of a series of box-office hits beginning in the 1980s, starting with the continuation of the STAR WARS saga, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in 1980 and RETURN OF THE JEDI in 1983. In 1981, he created the classic adventurer INDIANA JONES, star of three classic box-office hits as well as a television series, THE YOUNG INDIANA JONES CHRONICLES, which won 12 Emmy Awards.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Throughout the 1980s, Lucas helped bring to the screen an array of films as diverse as WILLOW, TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM and MISHIMA, and helped create unforgettable Disney theme park attractions. As chairman of Lucasfilm Ltd., Lucas oversaw its growth into all facets of filmmaking and entertainment. ILM has delivered revolutionary visual effects for scores of films and blazed new trails into the world of digital imagery. The computer graphic research division of Lucasfilm was spun-off in 1986 and became Pixar Animation Studios.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Skywalker Sound has applied its own perfection and devotion to the crafting of a film's soundtrack and post-production editing. Lucasfilm has been a post-production innovator, with such pioneering achievements as non-linear video editing systems that became the basis of the standard editing platforms used in film and television today.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Lucasfilm also includes LucasArts, a leading developer of home computer and console-based entertainment, and Lucas Licensing, which has expanded the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES brands into best-selling novels, toys and merchandise.",1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Lucas returned to directing in 1999 with STAR WARS: EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE. Three years later, STAR WARS: EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES was the first major live-action movie to be shot entirely digitally.
