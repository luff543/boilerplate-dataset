html body text center h3 span  ,THE REASON FOR THE SEASON,1,6
html body text center p span  ,by Ray C. Stedman,1,6
html body text p span  ,"Most scholars feel that the magnificent description of Christ found inverses 15-20 of Colossians 1 represents an early Christian hymn which Paulis quoting. These verses may represent the very first of all Christmascarols. If so; it is a hymn of two stanzas. The first concerns Jesus asLord of creation, i.e. the material universe, and all forces at work withinit. The second stanza speaks of Jesus as Lord of the new creation, the newhumanity. We have lost the tune for this hymn, but we still have thesewords which focus upon our Lord's overall supremacy.",1,5
html body text p span  ,Here are Paul's words:,1,5
html body text blockquote font b span  ,"""He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.""",1,7
html body text p span  ,"The church, of course, is the new creation. It is healthy to remindourselves of that because many churches seem to forget it. The church issomething eternally new which the world has never seen before. It is quitedifferent from any other organization or organism among men. It is a sadthing to observe the loss of this concept among Christians. As I travelabout I have noted the way people think about their church. I am afraidthat the most widespread concept is that the church is a religious countryclub, operated for the enjoyment and benefit of the members; it makes itsown rules and exists for its own purposes. That is a far cry indeed fromthe New Testament description of the church.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Others look upon the church as a collection of emotional misfits who arewaiting for the first bus to glory. I fear some of us give them good reasonto think that! Then there are those, like the Colossians, who are a groupof eager beaver religious fanatics, running after every new doctrine thatcomes along, especially if it offers a good feeling and has a sense ofmagic and mystery about it. That to many is the church.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"But here the apostle corrects these false ideas and declares that Jesus isthe Head of the body, which is the church. Paul relates the two together asa head and trunk relate in a physical body. This is one of the mostimportant statements in the New Testament about the church. God hasactually given us a model to carry around with us (our own body), so thatwe may understand how the church is to function. The church is a body, andwe all have bodies. The church has a Head, and we too have heads. Tounderstand the church and how it should function, think about your own bodyand how it functions.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"If you stand in front of a mirror you will notice, I hope, that there are two divisions of the body. The knob up on top, with more or less hair, we call the head. It is the control center of the body. The rest of the body, with its appendages of arms and legs, etc., is all part of the trunk. That is a body---and the head runs the body! Many churches seem to forget that. Think what would happen to your body if somebody removed your head. It doesn't appear that any of you has had that experience since most of you seem to be well attached. When I was a boy growing up in Montana, we did not buy chickens at the grocery store all nicely packaged in plastic. I had to go out and run one down, and then remove its head. A chicken with its head cut off acts very strangely. It does not simply quietly perish, but jumps and runs around, out of control for a minute or two, before it finally dies. Churches that lose their awareness of the Head are like that---they too go out of control. They do not know what to do. They run about and become involved in things they ought not to have anything to do with. They have, for all practical purposes, lost their Head.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"That was the trouble at Colossae. In chapter two Paul says they ""have lostconnection to the head."" It is essential, therefore, that a church musthave its Head in place and functioning: supplying direction, maintainingorder, giving it health, solvingits difficulties, coordinating itsactivities, and supplying to every single member its own kind of life. Thatis what your physical head does, and that is what Jesus, as Head of thebody, desires to do.This must find application on an individual basis. Oftentimes we fail tosee that a church consists of individuals. You are the church! It cannotact as a corporate body very often---it is not expected to. Yet, because wehave false concepts of the church, we often expect the corporation to actfor us. But Christ's body is not designed that way. Each individual isdirectly related to the Head. It is he who should direct each of us in ouractivities through the week. That is where the church truly functions, nothere on Sunday morning. Here is where the church is taught by the Head,where we learn how to function. But we actually function away from here, inour homes and neighborhoods. There we must relate directly to the Head,expecting him to open doors, provide energy, wisdom, comfort andforgiveness. That is where the church touches society on every side.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Yet, despite the fact that we are to function as individuals, we must neverforget that we belong to the whole, not only this local body but the wholebody of Christ all over the world. We are all related to one another. Thismarvelous mystery of relationship constitutes one of the most excitingthings in the world today. When the church functions properly it is far andaway the most powerfully effective body on earth. That is what Jesus meanswhen he said, ""You are the salt of the earth; you are the light of theworld."" As individuals we must remember that our part is to respond topersonal direction from the Head: to do as he says and obey his word.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Now Paul tells us, in two marvelously descriptive phrases, exactly whyJesus is the Head of the body. First, he says, ""he is the beginning."" Thebeginning of what? The beginning of the church! He is the One from whom thechurch gets its life. There are several ""beginnings"" in Scripture. TheBible opens on that note: ""In the beginning God created the heavens and theearth."" But that is not the beginning referred to here. There isanother""beginning""in the gospel of John: ""In the beginning was the Word.""That goes back even before creation. But that is not the ""beginning"" spokenof here either. The ""beginning"" here is the same one which John speaks ofin his letter: ""We know him who was from the beginning."" He is referring tothe beginning of the church, when the disciples saw Jesus, touched him andhandled him. From the risen life of Jesus flows the new life of the church.That is what Paul teaches so clearly in 2 Corinthians 5: ""If anyone be inChrist he is a new creation. Old things have passed away, all things havebecome new."" We are part of a new humanity that God is bringing forth uponthis earth, a humanity that is ""bought with a price"": ""You are not yourown, you are bought with a price."" Remember, ""He who knew no sin was madesin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.""",1,5
html body text p span  ,"This should remind us of that simple, often misunderstood parable, that ourLord told among several others, in Matthew 13. He says, ""The kingdom ofheaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one ofgreat value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.""Unfortunately, that parable has been interpreted to mean that Jesus is thepearl of great price, and that when we see what a valuable person he is wewill sell all we have and buy him. But that is entirely contrary to everyother teaching of Scripture. We do not buy God. We cannot purchase him orpurchase our salvation in any sense. We have nothing to offer him! We mustcome, as the old hymn puts it, ""Nothing in my hand I bring,/Simply to thycross I cling."" No, it is Jesus who is the merchant looking for a finepearl. And he finds one: it is the church! For it, ""he went away and soldeverything he had and bought it.""",1,5
html body text p span  ,"This is most instructive if you remember how a pearl is made. A pearl, youknow, starts out as an irritatedoyster! A grain of sand gets under theoyster's shell. To the oyster that feels like crackers in bed do to us. Itis very uncomfortable, and the oyster sets about getting rid of it. What itdoes is to cover the irritating grain of sand with a beautiful nacre thathardens into a lustrous and gorgeous pearl. That is how the church wasborn. It emerges from the wounded side of Jesus. It was the irritation thatwe represent by our sinful lives that put him to death, and he covers itover and heals it, making it into a beautiful pearl of great value. That isthe church. That is what Paul is describing here: Jesus himself is thebeginning of the church.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Then, secondly, Paul says, Jesus is ""the firstborn from among the dead.""Many take that to mean he is the first one ever to be resurrected. That iscertainly true. The resurrection of Jesus is the only resurrection that hasever occurred on this earth. Lazarus, and all the others who came back fromthe dead, were simply resuscitated: they came back to the same life theyhad left. We may even feel a bit sorry for them because they had to comeback to take it up again. But Jesus was truly resurrected. He was given aglorified life: he came from the grave at a far higher level than he wentin. He returned in a glorified body, subject to different laws and governedby different principles. But that is not what is meant here. That is whatPaul calls ""the first-fruits of them that slept."" But here ""firstborn""means what it does in verse 15. We have already seen that it means theowner, the possessor, of the old creation. Here then it means the owner,possessor, of the new creation. He is the One who alone possesses theresurrection life that he gives to each of us. That is what John is sayingin his first letter, in chapter 5, verse 11: ""This is the testimony: Godhas given us eternal life [deathless life, resurrection life], and thislife is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have theSon of God does not have life."" He may be moral, he may be a nice person,but he does not yet possess the life of eternity, the resurrection life ofJesus, because that life comes from Jesus alone.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Now it is a clear biblical fact that Christians who have received Christand been born into the new creation have this life. That is the reason theycan no longer excuse themselves for wrong behavior by saying, ""Well, afterall, I'm only human."" It is true you are human yet in the body, in theflesh, and that is why you are tempted, but because you also have a newlife it means you do not need to yield to that temptation; there is now anew power within.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"I feel constrained to get this across to people. When you become aChristian you have a new source of power which the world knows nothingabout. Therefore, you are expected to live at a different, higher level.And you can. You cannot excuse yourself by saying, ""I'm only human."" True,that is why temptations come, but God has given us an ability to say no tothese and to say yes to the power of Christ. We will not feel powerful---weare never expected to---but we have the power to say no; that is what thenew creation is all about.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Thus, because our Lord is Master of the old creation (the old, materialuniverse all around us)---and also master of a whole new humanity that isnow coming into being, Paul goes on to say that he is both firstborn of theold and firstborn of the new ""in order that he might have the supremacy.""There is nothing left out of his control. One of the old Christmas carolscaptures this beautifully,",1,5
html body text blockquote span  ,"King of kings yet born of Mary,",1,5
html body text blockquote span  ,"As of old on earth he stood,",1,5
html body text blockquote span  ,"Lord of lords in human nature,",1,5
html body text blockquote span  ,In the body and the blood.,1,5
html body text blockquote span  ,"He will give to all the faithful,",1,5
html body text blockquote span  ,His own self for heavenly food.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"That is the difference that being a Christian makes: we have Christ himself dwelling in us, and that enables us to be more than we once were. Paul now turns from our Lord's position as Head of the body to his work as the reconciler of all things.",1,5
html body text blockquote font b span  ,"""For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.""",1,7
html body text p span  ,"Notice how carefully the apostle links together the reconciling work ofChrist and his deity. Jesus had to be God to do what he did! At the ChicagoConference on Biblical Application which I mentioned last week I wasthrilled to hear Dr. Bruce Waltke make an impassioned plea that we who areworking with these great themes of Scripture find some way to reduce thesetheological statements to contemporary terms, because, as he put it, ""theworld is lost without a sense of God. Men and women everywhere desperatelyneed to know that there is Someone in charge of life, and that there is aSource to whom they can turn for help and for deliverance. The world needsto know that Jesus Christ is God."" He made the statement personal withthese words, ""If Jesus is not God, then I do not have a Savior."" That issurely true. If Jesus is not God there is no bridge that can span the chasmbetween God and man.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"This is why Christianity is often offensive to people of other faiths. Theysay, ""Why can't you recognize that all religions have leaders who can leadus into truth? Why do you claim that Jesus is different and above all theothers?"" That is often called ""the scandal of exclusivity,"" the exclusiveclaim that only one religious founder is both God and man. As C. S. Lewiswell states,If you had gone to Buddha and asked him, ""Are you the Son of Brahma?,"" hewould have said, ""My son, you are still in the vale of illusion."" If youhad gone to Socrates and asked, ""Are you Zeus?"" he would have laughed atyou. If you had gone to Mohammed and asked, ""Are you Allah?"" he would firsthave rent his clothes, and then cut your head off. If you had askedConfucius, ""Are you Heaven?"" I think he would have probably replied,""Remarks which are not in accordance with nature are in bad taste.""",1,5
html body text p span  ,"There is only One who claims that he is both God and man. This explains thename which the shepherds whispered when they came into the stable after theangels' announcement. They knelt in awe before the Babe lying there andbreathed the one word, ""Immanuel"" (God with us). He is the reason for theseason! I want to tell you it makes me angry to see the commercializationof Christmas. All this flim-flam about trees, and presents, and Santa Claustends to obscure this marvelous truth: that Baby was ""God reduced to aspan/Incomprehensibly a man"" and he is the only hope we have out of themess we find ourselves in. That is the glory of Christmas.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"But because Jesus is both God and man he is able to bridge the gap, ""toreconcile to himself all things."" This verse has been used as a proof textto substantiate the idea of universal salvation; that ultimately everyperson and every being is going to be redeemed. Even the devil and hisangels (this concept maintains), and even the wickedest of men such asHitler and Stalin and those who are far worse because of spiritual evil aresomeday going to be redeemed. There may be a temporary punishment, buteventually everything in the universe will be restored to God, and therewill be no hell and no eternal judgment. That is the teaching ofuniversalism.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"It is true that the word ""reconcile"" upon which this whole teaching hangs,does mean salvation in the case of those who believe. It is used in thatsense in the very next verses, where Paul goes on to say,",1,5
html body text blockquote font b span  ,"""Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.""",1,7
html body text p span  ,"That is clearly salvation in its fullest degree. But ""reconcile"" oftenmeans things other than salvation. This is where we must be very careful.Heresy can creep in at places where we do not expect it. It is wrong totake a single meaning of a word and press it everywhere as its onlymeaning.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"If you look elsewhere in Scripture you will find that ""reconcile"" isbroader than salvation. In Ephesians 2, for instance, Paul uses it of thehealing of hostility between Jew and Gentile. He says Jesus has come ""andbroken down the middle wall of partition and reconciled Jew and Gentile inone body,"" by which he means the hostility is ended. Not that every Jew andevery Gentile will be saved, but they will be able to live in harmony; thatis his point. In 1 Corinthians 7, the apostle says that husbands and wivesare to be ""reconciled"" to one another. There may be some husbands and wiveshere who need to have their hostility end and begin to live together inpeace. Parents and children need reconciling at times. Friends often needit. Christmas is a time when reconciliation between estranged familymembers takes place more than it does at other times of the year. The basicmeaning of this word is ""to remove all impediments to peace"" so thatharmony prevails.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"What does it mean, then, that Jesus shall ""reconcile to himself all things,whether things on earth or things in heaven""? It means a day is coming whenthe hostility of evil against righteousness will be brought to a suddenhalt. Evil men and angels will find themselves unable to function in theirenmity against God. They will be subdued, and will cease their rebellion.It does not mean their punishment ends; it is their active hostility thatwill cease. Then, at last, the terrible question that every one of us hasasked at times, ""Why does God permit evil?"" will be answered. There iscoming a day, according to this verse, when all will be explained to us:Why do the good suffer? Why do bad things happen to good people? Why doesinjustice reign triumphant at times? Why are innocent children raped,tortured, and killed, or ruined in mind and body by drugs or molestation?Why were six million Jews gassed to death in Germany? Why were millions ofothers elsewhere shot, speared, drowned, burned or hanged by the tyrants ofhistory? Why?",1,5
html body text p span  ,"We have all asked these questions. Why do accidents occur, ruining ourjoys? Why does insanity rage in so many? At last this question is to beanswered. At last we will learn why it was necessary to allow evil. Then wewill see it was part of the working out of God's program. Every hurt willbe resolved, every tear will be wiped away, every pain will be relieved. Atlast the whole universe will live in peace and harmony with one another.""Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all God's holy mountain."" Read the greatpromises of Isaiah in this regard. What glorious language he employs topicture an earth where nothing is out of step, nothing is eccentric,nothing is out of balance; everything is in harmony with everything else.That is what this declares. Surely this is what Paul is describing in thatgreat passage in Philippians. An hour is coming when ""every knee shall bowand every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God theFather."" That is where history is headed.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"The marvelous thing about this is that it flows out of the death of Jesuson the cross. It is the cross that has brought this to pass. That is why ithas been the central symbol of Christian faith since the very beginning. Weput crosses up in our sanctuaries, not to make us think that the cross wasa beautiful piece of wood, for it was a dirty, bloody, rugged means ofdeath. But out of that death has flowed life to all the universe. That iswhat this is telling us. We find it described very clearly in chapter twoof this letter, in the words, ""And having disarmed the powers andauthorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them bythe cross"" (2:15). It is the cross that is the center of all life.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Christians should never allow themselves to forget that wonderful scenerecorded in the book of Revelation, where John is caught up into glory andsees the end of history, the end of all human affairs. Here is how hedescribes it:",1,5
html body text blockquote font b span  ,"Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. In a loud voice they said: ""Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!"" Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: ""To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!"" The four living creatures said, ""Amen,"" and the elders fell down and worshiped.",1,7
html body text p span  ,"That is what Christmas initiates: it is the beginning of the great processthat shall end in the perfect harmony of all creation. We are privileged tohave a part in proclaiming this good news right now, and in our hearts togive honor and glory to the Lord Jesus, even before the rest of creationjoins in the song. Revelation closes with this reminder:",1,5
html body text blockquote font b span  ,"The Spirit and the bride say, ""Come!"" And let him who hears say, ""Come!"" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life... He who testifies to these things says, ""Yes, I am coming soon."" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all God's people. Amen. (Rev. 22:17ff)",1,7
