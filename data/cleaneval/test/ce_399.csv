html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"What will you wear to Europe? This is a major concern, but it issecondary. The real question is â€” how much? You are infinitelybetter off going with nothing but an umbrella and a toothbrush thanwith the load you would typically bring on a vacation in the UnitedStates.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Pack Light,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"As every traveler and chronicler of the subject relates,pack light. Seldom does anyone define the meaning of pack light,except to present a list of clothes and accessories to bring, nosuch list ever being universally practical. To enjoy travel, youmust pack light. To define pack light, travel with your chosen loadand see for yourself if it is convenient and gives you the freedomyou need.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Dress Sharp,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"It pays to be well presented, with a European flavor.Europeans are clothes conscious. Northern Europeans look somber,while brighter colors are more common as you go south. Clothesrepresent personality and social status. People weartheir better clothes almost all the time.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Europeans seeing you for the first time and only brieflywill judge you completely by your appearance, and will behaveaccordingly. Unfortunately for the traveler, most of your personalcontact in Europe will be with hotel clerks and cafe waiters. Tosecure a good room, good table, and good service, dress as if youdeserve it. In fact, you will be stopped at the door of many placesif you are not properly dressed.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Be Comfortable,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"In addition, you must keep yourself comfortable. NorthernEuropean weather is generally cooler, wetter, and more variablethan in the United States. South of the Alps and Pyrenees it can bewarm and stuffy just about any time of the year. Walking in and outof museums, restaurants, and stores may force you to off and onyour coat. In stores the heat from those little halogen lamps canbe very uncomfortable. Be ready for rain or shine, hot or cold.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Pack Light Field Test,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"I propose the following test, preferably taken in a lightrain.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Pack everything, put on your hat and coat, open yourumbrella, (raining or not), check the time, and walk one mile awayfrom home with everything you have. Then, pretending you are tryingto catch a train or trying to get to the tourist office before itcloses, run or walk home. If you can make the round tripcomfortably within 45 minutes, you have packed light. It is best ifyour test course includes a short, steep hill or several flights ofstairs, upwards on the return leg.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Also make sure that all of your traveling companions canpass the pack light field test. If not, old friends may becomelifetime enemies. Failure to obey the pack light rule will doom youin so many ways that you will be better off to stay home and wateryour tomatoes.

html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"The clothes worn by most American tourists announce them asAmericans better than any trilingual poster ever could. From theground up you're wearing: jogger or tennis shoes, worn Levi's,collared tee shirt, and ski jacket, with a backpack.

html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Go Like a Local,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"For a number of reasons you are better off looking like alocal citizen rather than a standard American tourist. Don't misinterpret this. I love the USA and all that it represents, but I try to avoid being an American billboard when I travel overseas. The primary reason is to avoid being a target of pickpockets, a breed endemic in Europe. You might also think that it could avoid being caught up in terrorist bombings as London had in July 2005. That is probably not an issue since the murdering sons of bitches just kill anybody, including fellow Muslims praying at their local mosque.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"For many years my personal preference was a pairof black slip-on shoes, wool/polyester blend slacks, turtleneckshirt, and sport coat. This ensemble will get you through almostany door in Europe with reasonable respect, keep you comfortableunder most weather conditions, and allow you to blend in withoutbeing instantly identified as ""the American.""",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"The wool/polyester blend slacks look more like wool thanplastic, but they wash drip dry. You won't need to iron theseif you care for them according to the label. Levi Strauss has introduced a new Dockers line available in several colors besides the normal khaki. A couple of pairs of the dark charcoal served me well throughout Europe on my January 2006 trip. Turtleneck shirts arenot common in America. In fact I couldn't find a single one in December 2005. The men's shops all said that they weren't in style this year. Booosh! You can find them inski clothing shops. If you are not in ski country get catalogs from Lands End and from L.L Bean for a good selection. I ended up buying a couple of good cotton T-necks at the V+D department store after I arrived in Holland. An open collar dress shirt is a good substitute for the turtleneck in warmer weather. In very few restaurants is a tie required, though you'll see them often in better establishments. For off-season travel, I also bring a lightweight turtleneck sweater. My sport coat has a herringbone pattern and travels very wellwithout showing wrinkles or minor stains.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Levi's,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Levi's and other brands of denim jeans became fashionable inEurope in the 1990's. Levi's are now tolerated in many cafÃ©sand restaurants during the day. However, regular slacks are muchmore common as street wear in major cities throughout Europe. Based on my observations of people walking through the central train stations of Europe less than 20% were wearing denim jeans. The preference for the vast majority, men and women, young and old, was black slacks.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Slacks are also much more in harmony with packing light. Levi's areheavy and bulky, and take a day to dry out when they get rained on. If you do wear denim, select a lightweight pair with a bit of fashion. You might want to consider wearing Levi slacks rather than Levi jeans. Levi Strauss makes a good looking line called ""Action Slacks."" These are 100% Dacron and travel very well. Wash them off in the shower at night and hang them to drip dry by morning. I have a couple pairs in black. I recently switched to another Levi Strauss product for my European travels and everyday wear. These are charcoal Dockers, 55% cotton and 45% MicroPolyester, style number 405189256. They are very comfortable and look like dress slacks.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"When strolling in major cities in the summer a lightweight pair of black slacks or skirt plus a white top will serve you well. This is standard attire for a large percentage of the native populations, and tourists from other European countries.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"I have no ambition of being a clothing cop so accept this chapter as you will. The advice is based on my personal experience in Europe. Yeah sure, you can wear your back yard jeans or shorts, t-shirt or no shirt, sneakers or flip flops, and that is the way you will be viewed and treated in the cosmopolitan cities throughout Europe. Expect no respect.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Dressing well does not have to apply only to Europe. I had drifted into wearing Levis at my local pub in Michigan a few years ago. One night last summer I was returning home from an event where I was wearing a jacket and slacks and decided to stop in at Oscar's, my regular place, to shoot some eight ball. It wasn't long before a young lady about half my age started bumping into me and making strong eye contact. After that I started wearing slacks and a dress shirt when I went to Oscar's. Approachments by young dames has happened again and again to the point that it has become embarrassing, but I won't brag on it. Guys, listen up here! Dress sharp and you won't need all those bull drop lines to meet a girl in Europe, or anywhere.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"I would expect that a woman dressed in Levi's would normally be approached by a man in more or less the same low-life outfit. It's only speculation, but I guess that if you want to meet the prince of your dreams in Europe you would dress to the nines. Why not? Besides, women in Levi's are about the most asexual creatures on the earth. I don't know why girls wear Levis. They are so unflattering to the derriÃ¨re. And it won't cost you much to dress better. It will probably cost you less than that name brand stuff. Think, have you been to your local second hand store recently. They have some great stuff at laughingly ridiculous low prices. You will want to tell your friends, as I have just done. Male speaking, I just bought a London Fog brand, zipper in liner,trench coat for $40. It looks better than the the one in my closet that I bought 15 years ago for $140. Well, I must admit that it is a bit out of fashion. Most coats in Europe are black and the length is just above the knee, so this thing is the wrong color and a foot too long per current styles.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Layers,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Dress in ""layers."" This means dressing in items that can be added to orremoved individually without changing everything when the weatherchanges. For example, instead of a heavy overcoat wear a sweater and a windbreaker. If it gets too warm in the afternoon take off the sweater and carry it in a shopping bag. Dressing in layers requires that all of your clothes be complementaryand mixable. Dark, neutral, and earth colors tend to avoid fashionclashes, and do not need cleaning as often as lighter colors.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Shoes,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"In Europe you'll notice all sorts of footwear â€” boots,clogs, tennis, joggers, sandals, army issue, and Italian fashion.Many people will see and examine your shoes before their eyes comeup to meet yours, if they ever do.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Appearance is important.Wear a good looking, durable, broken-in pair of shoes. Your averageAmerican department store shoes will probably be mistaken forItalian fashion. Perfect. An average pair of polished black slip-ons will get you in the door anywhere. Also, rubber soles willsurvive far better than leather soles on the rain soaked sidewalksof Europe.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Instead of shoes, I have become a convert to sandals, morespecifically Birkenstocks, a German brand. Once you break in a pairof Birkenstocks you will never go back to shoes again, except forduring stormy weather. You won't even want to go barefoot again. Birkenstocks have a half inch of cork between the hard rubber bottom and the leather part you rest your feet in. Cork is very easy to walk on. You can go all day in these things. I recommend black socks with the Birkenstocks, unless you are at the beach. Birkenstocks are expensive so you can make this one of your purchases when in Germany, at prices 50% less than the American prices.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Carry an extra pair of shoes since it is likely that yourshoes will get soaked occasionally. If you invest in a pair withnatural leather uppers, you can oil them to the point that theyresist water like wax paper. Use mink oil or equivalent once aweek.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Again, do not wear any kind of sports shoes, e.g. tennis,jogging, or whatever else they call them these days. I was withsome business associates in The Hague a few years ago and wedecided to take a pub crawl. Two of them had just bought new joggershoes and wore these out for the evening stroll. Several placeswould not allow them in the door. These places were just youraverage Dutch cafÃ©s and bars, not fancy or up-scale. Andmy associates were businessmen in their 50s, certainly good potentialcustomers in any establishment. Those doormen want to keep their jobs so they keep theoff-spec people outside. Nothing looks clunkier than freshwhite tennies. I've heard that the French call them marshmellows. In my Amsterdam and Brussels train station observations, jogger shoes were worn by less than 5% of those passing through, usually by young people with backpacks.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"An alternative for those who like tennies is the Florsheim line of shoes called ""Comfortech."" These are light weight black slip-ons with a cushion bottom. They look great at a distance and will get you past any maitre d' or doorman.",1,13
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td strong span  ,Rain Gear,1,14
html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Weather protection is essential. Bring a telescopingumbrella. You can find umbrellas which slide down to under 10 inches. A lightweight hooded mackintosh is veryhandy for those frequent all day rains. A light pair of leathergloves and a hat are helpful for off-season travel, and can even beuseful in northern Europe in the summer.",1,13

html body text center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Friends who have read this book often say that it is overly male oriented. A major reason,perhaps, is my discussion of clothing, but the attitude probablysurfaces in other areas as well. I've seen packing lists on the internet written by women who must have had a platoon on hand to carry their utterly essential stuff.

She wore a black jumpsuit, colorful scarf, a fashionable raincoat, and carried a slightlyoversized purse with everything she needed. Although our room was a nice one in an above averagehotel, there was hardly enough space to hang my things or stash thesuitcases.
