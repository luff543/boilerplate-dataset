html body text table tbody tr td center p i b span  ,Object of Installing System,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,To reduce the fire and conflagration hazard to a minimum.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,First: To practically dispense with the use of steam portable fire engines.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Second: To supply sufficient water at the scene of an incipient fire, to extinguish it in the shortest possible time.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Third: To quickly concentrate large volumes of water on area in which a fire may have reached dangerous proportions.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Fourth: To furnish in emergency as much water as can be used to advantage by the fire department.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td center i b span  ,The Reason Gravity System is Superior,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"This method of supply possesses decided advantages over all others because of its positiveness and economy of operation and the short time required to get the water on a fire. It is not necessary to telephone to a central station and start pumps, or to make connections to fire boats. And it possesses none of the various uncertainties inherent to complicated mechanical equipment.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Putting Twin Peaks Reservoir in service, it will increase static pressure at base 168 pound to square inch in lower zone.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td center i b span  ,Advantages,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,The advantages briefly are as follows:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,First: It eliminates steam fire engines which hitherto have been the main reliance. It is thus a measure of great economy. It also reduces excitement which is important near schools and hospitals.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Second: It reduces the additional alarms and numbers of companies and apparatus required.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Third: The supply of water is better and more powerful. Saltwater could be had on short notice in case of emergency from two saltwater pumping stations. Should this supply prove inadequate, it can be increased by two fire boats.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Fourth: Stretches are shorter, meaning quicker work and greater economy of hose and men.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Fifth:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p a span  ,It greatly reduces insurance rates,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,. Within a number of years (the system) will pay for itself.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td center i b span  ,High Pressure Hydrants,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The capacity of a high pressure hydrant depends upon the amount of pressure at the main. The capacity when the pressure is at its highest amounts to about 3,000 gals per minute. The diameter on the various valves on a high pressure hydrant are main valves, pilot valve 3'' diameter square independent 3 1/2 reduced to 3 inches with reducers. With the exception of the one facing street which is 3 1/2 inches.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The pilot valve is a small valve placed in the center of the main valve, it is used as a bypass. The diameter of the main valve is seven inches. The service area: 38 square inches.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The action of the valve is in a downward direction when opening, and the movement is against the course or pressure of water entering the standpipe. Under these circumstances it would be very difficult to make an opening on a high pressure hydrant.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Therefore, the object of the pilot valve is to meet these conditions so that an opening can be affected in any high pressure. The pilot, which is inside the main valve, equalizes the pressure above and below the main valve and has a 3 inch diameter and a surface of 7 square inches.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The pilot in the main valve is so arranged that the first turn of the stem operates the small valve inside only, and therefore allows the water to pass the pilot valve and the main valve into the stand pipe of the hydrant.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Capacity: 9950 gals per minute, with three outlets at 150 pounds pressure exclusive of friction loss.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td center i b span  ,Methods of Using System,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Pressure in Jones St. Tank lower zone:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If greater pressure is required, a signal is sent calling for Ashbury Pressure or from Twin Peaks reservoir. If Jones St. pressure is not sufficient, Gateman at Jones St. operates proper valves to permit water from Ashbury or Twin Peaks to flow direct into lower zone.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If Twin Peaks is called for, gateman at Ashbury Tank operates proper valves and permits flow from Twin Peaks direct into mains. In connecting to a hydrant, see that the independent valve is closed. Connect regulating valve and see that it is shut off.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Open king valve, open independent outlet valve. Wait for orders to turn on water. Operate regulating valve according to pressure ordered.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td center i b span  ,A Description of the High Pressure System,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The high pressure system consists of lines or mains, diameter of same varying from 10 to 20 inches extending about 9 1/2 miles throughout the congested value district, the important retail, wholesale and hotel districts and a large part of the residence district.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Three-way hydrants are connected to the mains with sublets of 3 1/3 inches, two outlets reduced to 3 inches. 1350 hydrants are used and 1120 gates so placed that when repairs are necessary only a small portion of the system may be out of service.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Provision is made to cut out those portions of the city where an earthquake would by most likely to damage the system.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td b span  ,The system is fed from the following sources:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Twin Peaks reservoir at an elevation of 758 feet at water level capacity of 10,500,000 gallons.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Ashbury Tank at an elevation of 494 feet at water level capacity of 500,000 gallons.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Jones St. Tank at an elevation of 369 feet at water level capacity of 750,000 gallons.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The system is divided into two zones. Jones St. Tank supplies the lower zone. Ashbury Tank supplies the upper zone. Static pressure at the base of the lower zone is 160 pounds to the square inch. With Ashbury pressure on, the lower zone pressure at city base is 214 pounds. Twin Peaks pressure at city base would be about 328 pounds to square inch.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Two saltwater pumping stations with 10,800 gallons per minute capacity for each. These stations have four steam multi-stage turbine pumps, one located at the foot of Van Ness Avenue and one at Second and Townsend Sts may also pump into the system.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Two fire boats each with a capacity of 10,000 gallons per minute may pump into the system from manifolds, each with ten inlets located at the foot of Washington and the foot of Powell St. The sources of supply are Spring Valley Water Company and S.F. Bay.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Spring Valley water is mainly taken from Clarendon Height through Ashbury Pumping Station and pumped to Twin Peaks by two centrifugal pumps driven by two 60-horsepower electric motors which are capable of delivering 700 gallons a minute each against 125 pound head. Ashbury Tank, elevation 465 feet, is filled by gravity from Spring Valley Clarendon Heights tank taken through 6-inch pipe, elevation 600 feet.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Jones St. Tank, elevation 334 feet, is mainly filled from Ashbury Tank. In emergency Jones St. Tank could be filled by the Spring Valley Tank, Clay St. at an elevation of 375 feet.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Alarms are received at all reservoir pumping stations and fire boats over a circuit being direct on a punch register. These are termed high-pressure calls.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Pumping stations, to pump capacity against 335 pounds pressure per square inch, are provided with sufficient fuel and fresh water to continue 7 hours.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Fire boats are able to pump 10,000 gallons a minute against 150 pounds pressure or 5,000 gallons a minute against 325 pounds pressure, per square inch.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,It (the high pressure system) protects all the section of the city located within the following boundaries and can be used for some distance outside this district:,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,All that section of the city east of Golden Gate park from mains on Clayton and Ashbury St.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Western Addition: Extreme westerly main on Devisadero St. running to Pacific Ave. to Van Ness Ave. to Polk St. Along Van Ness Ave. to the Bay, that section east of Van Ness Ave. south of Market west so far as Castro and south so far as 29th. Twenty-Sixth along Harrison and Folsom, Berry Street and the bay shore.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,A short extension runs from 8th and Townsend to 15th and Kansas to a dead end.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Special valves for reinforcing the lower zone are at Seventeenth west of Castro and Market St. west of Second. These have 16 gates.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The two gates would be ordered open in case of an extra large fire, or fires when the department was using more water than the 18-inch pipe leaving Jones St. Tank could supply to the lower zone.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Under ordinary conditions, Twin Peaks and Ashbury Reservoirs are put in service to Lower Jones through manifolds in the gate house at Jones Tank. The extra pressure of Ashbury or Twin Peaks will put Jones St. Tank out of service automatically.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td center i b span  ,Fire Boats,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Two pumps installed in each boat. Each pump has 2 unit multi-state turbine type. The casing of some of the pumps will be made sufficiently strong to withstand a pressure of 300 pounds per sq. inch.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The suction and discharge pipes will be arranged so that each pump may be connected to draw water from the Bay and deliver it into the delivery pipes on the boat, or one pump may deliver from the Bay into the suction of the other at a pressure of 150 pounds per sq.-inch and this pump will increase the pressure to 300 pounds per sq.-inch and discharge into delivery pipes of the boat.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"By this means a pumping set may deliver 4,000 gallons per minute against a pressure of 150 pounds per sq. inch or 2,000 gallons per minute against a pressure of 300 pounds per sq. inch.",1,9

Take off 2 iron nuts, take off hold down nut bronze, remove old leather seat, put new leather seat on screw on fittings named above and assemble in same manner.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Notify Battalion Chief and 1st alarm company.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td i b span  ,"What care and attention do valves, hydrants and man holes require?",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Valves and hydrants should be inspected each week; should be wiped, oiled, tested and if any leak should be seen around glands, should be taken up or repacked. Hose connections on hydrants should also be inspected and hydrantman should be positive that all threads on same were not jammed so fireman would have no trouble connecting hose.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Man holes should be inspected and keep dry, free from water. Spindles on all outlets should be made to work freely. By opening independent slide valve and keeping main valve closed, it would be possible to know whether main valve seat was tight and in good order.
