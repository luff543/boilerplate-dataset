html body text div div p b a span  ,An open letter to everyone in the world about everything that matters,1,9
html body text div div p span  ,"A couple of years ago a major Internet debate erupted about RSS. Everyone got involved, people who made products that competed with mine, developers who didn't like me, even some people who I thought were my friends. They all said one thing over and over. RSS sucks. Dave sucks. Let's have a rebellion. Dave is an echo. Dave is an outage. He's an incredible control freak. Let's route around him! That'll teach him a lesson.",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,I don't know what I was thinking. I guess my ego got in the way. My bad. I should have listened. Why? Because they were right! I do suck. I am an incredible control freak. RSS is a terrible format. It can't possibly work. How could I have been so dense? Obviously Atom is the way to go. Anything would be better than RSS! Oh the time I've wasted. Look at all the work we have to do now.,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,How can I possibly make it up to you? I've been a very bad person.,1,7

html body text div div p b a span  ,What is Amazon's OpenSearch?,1,9
html body text div div p span  ,I just heard about,1,7
html body text div div p a span  ,OpenSearch,1,8
html body text div div p span  ,", which is a new service whose slogan is:",1,7
html body text div div p em span  ,"""We want OpenSearch to do for search what RSS has done for content.""",1,8
html body text div div p span  ,"I think I've kind of figured it out. Basically it's a way for search engines to plug into a user interface, kind of like a portal, like My Yahoo, where each of the modules presents its results with an RSS feed.",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"But if that's right, what do we need A9 for? Why wouldn't you just plug the RSS straight into your aggregator? When they re-tooled My.Yahoo for RSS, didn't they obviate the need for something like this?",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,I must be missing something.,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,Enlighten me.,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"PS: My guess is this is a project that made sense at one time, but the shipdate slipped, and others filled the gap (search engines offering their results as RSS is not new in Spring 2005).",1,7
html body text div div p span  ,PPS: Could someone who's at Etech ask them if they have filed any patents on this.,1,7
