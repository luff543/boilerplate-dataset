html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"The presence of a Leader is often necessary for the constructive development of the Club. Many groups of girls have but few ideas for the activities upon which their Clubs should enter. Given a good suggestion from their leader, however, they are able to enlarge upon it and add their own ideas. Other girls have suggestions which are practicable for Club work only after they have been adapted to the particular situation at hand. A farseeing Club Leader receives such suggestions and tactfully modifies them for her particular Club. Such functions of a Club Leader could scarcely be performed by one of the girls themselves, for it is the more mature judgment of the leader which enables her to meet and to solve the problems of Club life.",1,12

They agree to do so — and another Girls’ Club has been organized. To be sure, groups of girls do organize into Clubs without any outside suggestion. Such groups sometimes apply for admission into a Settlement House organization. They have been together in school and now they wish to have a Club. In any case, the group of girls is there. They can be organized. Now what about a Leader?",1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"The obvious answer to this question seems to be, “a woman.” And this answer comes naturally because women have successfully held the leadership of the majority of Girls’ Clubs. Men have, at times, wisely directed such organizations, especially when the Club has met for some class work and the man in charge has been qualified to teach in that definite work. But a woman seems especially fitted for Club leadership because of her understanding of the problems which the girl constantly meets. The Camp Fire Girls’ Manual outlines the qualifications of a “Guardian” (as the Camp Fire Leaders are called) in the following way: “Camp Fire Guardians are older women, who, because of their larger experiences, are able to lead the girls into larger interests. Mothers are urged to become Guardians, and the meetings are usually held in the homes or out-of-doors.”",1,12

html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"] enthusiastic young women, full of the “stunts” which girls enjoy. And they have been successful under older women who have had the spirit of youth in their hearts. The kind of Leader desired depends upon the situation at hand. The social worker hunts for a volunteer worker. The employer searches for someone to employ. In either case, the task is essentially the same. The social worker must find someone who is willing to take up the task and who will be faithful to her responsibilities. The employer must find a Club worker who is primarily interested in the development of the girls, rather than in the salary he will pay her for the work.",1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Each Club presents its special problems and often the Leader should be definitely qualified to meet those problems. The Leader of a Girls’ Canning Club in the country must understand the art of canning and preserving. She will, whenever possible, introduce into the Club life those social elements which mean so much to the lonely country girl; but, first and foremost, the Club has been organized to can.

It is always of great help, however, in planning the work of any Club, to know at the outset what the prospective Leader is able to do in any special line. The Settlement or Guild director can then often suggest certain activities when she knows that the Leader is qualified to carry them on. The Club Leader herself does not always realize that her talents can be of practical use, until the questioning of the organizer brings the matter to her attention and points out the possibilities. This search for some talents often reveals others which are equally useful, and the Club Leader comes to realize this important fact—that Girls’ Club work is wide in its possibilities and its requirements, and that—whatever she herself can do well—this very training can be passed on to her girls.",1,12

html body text div center table tbody tr td div h4 span  ,General qualifications,1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"But such specially trained young people are not always available. Many of our smaller and country communities have no specially educated women upon whom they may call for Club leadership. This should not mean that a Club cannot be started in these places. There can always be found a club Leader for the girls, if careful search is made. Many a mother has been found who has welcomed such an opportunity to meet with her daughter and her daughter’s friends and to be “chums” with them. Often school teachers have been persuaded to undertake the work; they have been glad to meet the girls in an informal way and to put aside the relationship of being the “teacher.” The Camp Fire Manual suggests these points in the selection of a Leader. “Guardians should be appointed from among those (1) who personally know the families of the girls; (2) with whom the parents will cooperate.” If a woman [",1,12

Without this other, the most brilliantly talented Club Leaders have failed in their efforts. With it, those coming to their Clubs with apparently empty hands have made of their Clubs vital organizations. This primary consideration is the spirit of the Leader. To have the Club do its most effective work, the leader must be wholeheartedly interested in its members and their development. Real interest in the girls means interest not merely in their meetings of one or two hours a week or a month. The influence of the best Club Leader extends far beyond these comparatively short periods of their being together in the Club, out into the lives, of the girls, whether at home, at work, or in school. She gets intimately acquainted with them and knows their family life, their problems, and their interests.

She had called in the homes of the girls and had come to know their families. She remembered their birthdays with cards and went to see them when they were sick. She gave parties for them to which they were sometimes invited to bring young men. She could not direct plays or get up a Glee Club, and yet when her girls wished to do those things, they had little difficulty in finding someone who was willing to help them in that special line.

And, on the contrary, how often has she blessed the Club Leader who is always present at meetings, always on time, and who has always made the plans for which she said she would be responsible! The best Club Leader places faithfulness to her word before her own personal pleasure, and her influence upon the girls is strong or weak according as she considers her Club important or unimportant. One Club Leader once wrote a pledge which, in her opinion, was the most important for a worker among girls to observe. The pledge was as follows: “I will always keep my promises to my girls, unless some real reason prevents. By real reason, I do not mean an attractive social engagement.”",1,12
html body text div center table tbody tr td div p i span  ,Ability to be fair and to treat all Club members impartially,1,13
html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"is also desirable in a Club Leader. It is difficult to be constantly impartial when some of the girls seem so responsive and so well worth the effort expended upon them, while others are far from being attractive and are coldly indifferent. Unless a Club Leader is on her guard, she will quite naturally fall into the habit of referring to one or two Club girls as ideal Club members, and before she knows it, the rest of the Club will charge her with having “pets.” Those who have had little interest before will seize upon this as an excuse for their indifference.

html body text div center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"The necessity for maintaining wholesome friendships is closely allied to this ability to treat all with impartiality. Any who have dealt with girls know what a “crush,” or passionate hero-worship, is; and have come to dread its appearance as destructive to team work and Club cooperation. Incipient hero-worship is but natural in girls. They are at the hero-worshiping age. The wise Club Leader will not shun nor treat with disdain the young ‘girl who dogs her footsteps. Rather, she will make of it the opportunity for developing a real and vital friendship. And by showing an attitude of simple cordiality and dispassionate interest, she will almost invariably be able to win a steady loyalty quite different from flaming and fluctuating adoration, and far more lasting. A director of many Girls’ Clubs once pointed with pride to the fact that this spirit of passion was lacking in all of her organization. “Some people will tell you that it is impossible to carry on Girls’ Club work without it,” she remarked, “but it is possible and we know it because we have done it. To be sure, we have had a policy of aiming at wholesome friendships and have kept it constantly before us. More than this, we have",1,12

A Club Leader in a business house once decided to organize a Club among some young girls to meet during the lunch hour. The girls were interested in dancing, so she taught them simple folk dances. At the outset, she had had in mind the conducting of a class like the Physical Training classes she had conducted in her gymnasium. She soon found that she could not do it in that way. At first she was inclined to reprimand the girls for getting out of line and for giggling, but when she stopped to consider the fact that lunch time was their only free hour during the day, she soon lost all desire to see them standing in rows,’ learning steps the entire time. So there was no reprimand for the girls who laughed heartily at their own efforts to do the dances. She provided songs and games for part of the half-hour with the result that when the time came for the dance work, the girls invariably gave earnest attention to it. The result of this policy on her part was the creation of an atmosphere of sociability and enjoyment rather than of work to be done. [",1,12

If, through them all, she is able to preserve her self-control, she will have contributed vitally to the development of her girls, who are often sadly in need of that very self-control. The force of a good example is perhaps never exerted more powerfully’ than in showing control of one’s temper when the Club work is difficult. “She never gets mad when you’re bad,” said one girl of a beloved Camp Director, “but she makes you feel pretty mean when you break rules, because she’s always so sorry about it!”",1,12

She has been given a group of girls to lead along the lines of useful development. The activities of the Club and her personal relationship with them must further this aim. In order to accomplish this, she must know each girl. Her help can then be given wisely. But such acquaintance cannot be gained, at once, nor without definitely searching for it. For “knowing each girl” means far more than being able to recognize her upon the street and calling her by name. It includes acquaintance with her family and her home life, her education, her surroundings, her interests—in short, an acquaintance with the forces which have made her what she is. If, a Leader has definitely in mind what she wishes to, know about her girls, any conversation will give her an opportunity to learn the desired facts. It may be some time before the Leader knows all that she wishes concerning her girls. Many Club Leaders have found it far wiser to approach the girls gradually than to go to them in the attitude of a cross-questioner and by constant questioning to arouse their suspicions and antagonism. A friend, however, confides in a friend. Once a Club Leader has proved herself a friend to her girls, girlish confidences follow and the Leader is in a position to advise and direct wisely.",1,12
