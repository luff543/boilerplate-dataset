html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Let's take a look at why some training sessions are producing reallydynamite results while others leave participants wondering what the point of the meetingwas.,1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"1. W. I. I. F. M. (What's in it for me!) In some meetings participantsare there because it's expected of them, attending because they feel obligated or the bosstold them they had to attend. As an old saying goes, ""You can lead a horse to waterbut you can't make him drink."" Some companies and organizations fail to""sell"" participants on the benefits of training sessions, they assume theyalready know. Big mistake. Be sure people understand the point of each training event andspecifically how the new knowledge benefits them.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"2. Long winded people discussing the interior of a ping-pong ball! Iknow it's a temptation to use knowledgeable industry people and in some cases, necessary.Unfortunately many people who normally don't speak in public are generally boring. Thelonger their presentation, the duller it gets and people in the audience""turn-off"" mentally. Another great training opportunity slips away.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"The solution of course is to use people with experience in training orat the least, speaking before others. Not only are they more interesting to hear, theyunderstand how to pace the meeting and most importantly, when to stop making a point.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"3. Irrelevant information. People going to meetings expect to enjoythemselves, be entertained and learn new ideas in a positive atmosphere. Informationpresented at training sessions must be carefully distilled to the essential points. If astory is told, an example given or even a joke is used it must be relevant to the issue athand. Additionally the material must be presented in an orderly fashion so participantscan follow along. Finally, it needs to be current material, not a rehash of tired oldideas.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Before you permit someone to do training, make sure they have a focusedoutline or curriculum in writing to follow and have done this before. Working from noteson scraps of paper or worse, from memory, produces poor programs with attendees mentallyturned off long before the program finishes. This isn't the place to practice.",1,17
html body text table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"4. Keep it upbeat. Training sessions require a positive ambiance, thefeeling that learning is not only pleasant, but the knowledge contributes to theparticipants success. The person who facilitates should be upbeat and able to communicatethe benefits of the training to the participants in a positive way. When people feel theyare learning something that will help them and in a positively charged environment, thelearning comes easy!",1,17
