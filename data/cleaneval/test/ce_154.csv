html body text div h2 span  ,Book Review: Beyond Fear,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Now that I've lured you all here with my sensitive handling of emotional nuance, let's switch gears and geek out for a while. I want to talk about Bruce Schneier's new book",1,6
html body text div div a em span  ,Beyond Fear,1,8
html body text div div span  ,". Bruce was nice enough to send me a copy back in May, when I wrote about",1,6
html body text div div a span  ,systematic errors in risk perception,1,7
html body text div div span  ,". I read it in one big gulp, and ever since then I've been carrying it around in my briefcase, waiting to have enough time to write a review. Here it is.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,Bruce Schneier is a security expert who achieved his fame in the field of cryptography and Internet security and has subsequently branched out to write and consult about general security issues.,1,6
html body text div div em span  ,Beyond Fear,1,7
html body text div div span  ,"is his attempt to demystify security for the post-9/11 general public. His general thesis is that all security decisions, ranging from a homeowner's decision about whether to buy a burglar alarm to a government's decision about whether to spy on its own citizens, are based on the same general concepts. By understanding these concepts, we can make rational decisions about whether and how proposed security measures should be implemented, rather than being driven by fear.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Schneier proposes a five-step process for evaluating any security measure: (1) What assets need to be protected? (2) What are the risks to these assets? (3) How well does the security solution mitigate those risks? (4) What other risks does the security solution cause? (5) What costs and tradeoffs does the security solution impose? Schneier models the five-step process in sidebars throughout the book, applying it to security decisions as diverse as ""should I use my credit card to make purchases over the Internet?"" and ""should I invade Iraq to protect my country from terrorism?""",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"The five steps seem simple, even obvious, but consider how often they're overlooked in public debate. For example, since 9/11 we have frequently been told by pundits that ""giving up a few rights is a small price to pay for safety,"" and have been encouraged to skim over inconvenient questions about how much safety we're actually getting for the price.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"I found two of Schneier's concepts particularly useful. First is the notion that everyone involved in a security decision has their own agenda, and that, as illustrated",1,6
html body text div div a span  ,here,1,7
html body text div div span  ,", these agendas are often driven by factors unrelated to security â€“ such as profit or PR or the need for people to",1,6
html body text div div em span  ,feel,1,7
html body text div div span  ,"safe. Non-security agendas aren't necessarily bad things. For example, Schneier points out that during the 2002 sniper attacks on the Washington DC area, many parents drove their children to school despite the fact that, statistically, the children were at greater risk of dying in a car accident than a sniper attack. Driving them to school was valuable because it provided emotional security, not because it increased their physical security. Schneier's point is not that non-security agendas must be eliminated, but that they must be understood - and not mistaken for real security factors.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"The other concept I found especially useful is that every security decision involves tradeoffs. We can't decide to have ""no compromises"" when it comes to security, we can only decide where our compromises will be, who will bear the brunt of them, and how we will deal with them. Explicit discussion of security tradeoffs is often avoided, as anyone who's read the ""child safety"" sections of parenting magazines can attest. That makes it awfully difficult to reject proposed security measures. (""Well, why",1,6
html body text div div em span  ,wouldn't,1,7
html body text div div span  ,"we want to do it, if it saves just one life... if there's the smallest chance..."") We can't make rational decisions about security without articulating and choosing among the associated tradeoffs.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,The first part of,1,6
html body text div div em span  ,Beyond Fear,1,7
html body text div div span  ,"outlines the basic principles of Schneier's approach to security decision-making. The second part of the book discusses specific elements of threats, attackers, defenses, and countermeasures (for example: ""Brittleness makes for bad security,"" ""Detection works where prevention fails""), in short chapters filled with vivid real-world examples. Schneier's got a gift for logical exposition; reading this book, I frequently found myself saying ""how obvious!"" in response to a point I knew had never occurred to me before. At the end of the book, I felt much more confident in my ability to understand security debates and participate intelligently in the discussion.",1,6

She'll spend a year of her babyhood encased in heavy plaster, unable to move anything below her armpits. She'll have surgery 11 times in her first 23 years of life, several of which will ultimately prove to be failures. She'll have a chronic pain condition by the age of 12.

html body text div div a span  ,this painful article,1,7
html body text div div span  ,makes clear. It also makes it clear that there are people who choose abortion because of disabilities that are,1,6
html body text div div em span  ,much,1,7
html body text div div span  ,less severe than mine.,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"I used to say, ""I don't have a problem with abortion on the basis of 'I don't want to have a child right now,' I have a problem with abortion on the basis of 'I don't want to have THIS child.' "" But I can't sustain that kind of moral smugness in the face of",1,6

I know differently. Some parents of disabled children - mine, incidentally, among them - rise to the occasion and do a fantastic job. Others don't. My dissertation added to the research literature demonstrating that congenitally disabled children are at greater risk of parental abuse. So I'm under no illusions about the stress, pain, uncertainty, and financial and physical burdens that come with parenting disabled children. And yet I also know that disabled people can make valuable contributions to both family life and society at large. I know that life as a disabled person - even a severely disabled person - can be well worth living.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,Where does that leave me? With,1,6
html body text div div a span  ,Barbara Ehrenreich,1,7
html body text div div span  ,". Her op-ed in yesterday's New York Times takes on ""the prejudice [...] that a termination for medical reasons is somehow on a higher moral plane than a run-of-the-mill abortion."" Ehrenreich supports the right to ""run-of-the-mill abortion,"" of course, and so do I. Absolutely. But I also refuse to concede that women who abort a disabled fetus have made a choice that's better or more understandable or more deservedly legal than women who have aborted a fetus because they fear they'll never finish college with a baby, or because they've always disliked children. It always comes down to a personal choice, a personal weighing of uncertain costs and benefits. I may not always be morally comfortable with the resulting decisions - but, then again, no one has asked me to be. I don't have to approve of every single abortion to remain determinedly pro-choice.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"This next paragraph is pretty much beside the point, but I don't want to leave the first part of my post unbalanced. So: in my imaginary scenario, here's what the Prenatal Diagnosis Fairy didn't say.",1,6
html body text div div blockquote span  ,"""Your baby will grow up smart and determined. She'll earn a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, make some original contributions to the research literature, and help people work through the most painful aspects of their lives. She'll be a good cook. She'll use that deformed arm to play the piano passably well and to complete elaborate needlework projects. She'll have great friends and some successful romantic relationships and a happy marriage. Her disability will cause intense physical and mental pain over the years, and sometimes it will be bitter and awful. But it will also make her stronger and tougher. By the age of 30, she'll have recovered enough mobility to be able to hike three miles over rough terrain, and to her that will feel like a marathon-quality accomplishment. Over the years she'll be active in political campaigns, volunteer organizations, and her church. People will listen when she speaks. And eventually, she'll create a modestly successful weblog that will forever associate her in people's minds with small, furry, aquatic mammals. So when you make your decision, keep those parts in mind, too.""",1,7

The 1999 poll found that 85% of Americans had read a book of any kind in the previous year, and that 55% had read six or more books in the past year. Those results are dramatically at odds with the Census Bureau's report that in 1992 only 60.9% of Americans read a book of any kind in the previous year, and that the percentage has been dropping since. The Times article also cites the Association of American Publisher's report that total sales of ""consumer book products"" increased 6% worldwide in 2003, a gain mostly attributed to increased sales of e-books and audiobooks.

Today my hometown supports an enormous Barnes & Noble as well as several smaller chains. Lots of small towns can report the same experience.

Again, from my own experience - when I lived in the suburbs, I could never get a close parking space at the library. My current urban library is always full of people, not just in the video section but deep in the stacks of the Humanities section.

It's all classes of Americans. It's not just computer books or self-help books or cat books. We're in an absolute commercial explosion of literary publishing.
