Those measures culminated with the enactment of ""three strikes"" legislation around the nation. Beginning with Washington State in 1993, by the end of the decade, the federal government and over half of all states had enacted some form of a ""three strikes"" law. Roughly contemporaneous with these measures, crime rates have declined nationwide. Advocates of severe incarceration policies have claimed that ""three strikes"" laws are responsible for that decline.",1,15

Further, its provisions include residential burglary as a possible qualifying strike. Finally, the third strike, triggering the twenty-five-year-to-life term of imprisonment, may be any felony.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"However, despite the claims of ""three strikes"" supporters, the data on which they rely do not withstand close scrutiny. More recent empirical research supports many of the claims of ""three strikes"" critics that the law simply cannot deliver on its promises and insofar as it may have some marginal deterrent effect, it comes at too high a cost.",1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"Comparing California’s decline in crime with the national average, as Secretary of State Jones does when he asserts that ""three strikes"" accounts for California exceeding the decline in crime nationwide, cuts both ways. New York, not California, showed the sharpest decline in crime during the time in question. While some of New York’s policing policies have raised serious civil rights concerns, it was not one of the states that adopted a ""three strikes"" law during the 1990s. Hence, its decline in crime cannot be attributed to such legislation.",1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"A number of recently published studies also raise doubts about the true effectiveness of ""three strikes"" laws in lowering California’s crime rate.

The authors’ findings suggest that, prior to ""three strikes,"" crime rates were declining already and, after ""three strikes"" they continued to decline at about the same rate, suggesting that whatever effect ""three strikes"" had, it was small at best. The book also notes that, partly because ""three strikes"" casts such a broad net, the offenders arrested under its provisions were no more likely to be high-rate offenders than non-""three strikes"" arrestees. Nor were they more likely to commit violent offenses.",1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"Although its proponents originally explained that ""three strikes"" would work because it would incapacitate high-rate offenders, the decline in the crime rate came too early to be explained on that basis—""three strikes"" is a sentence enhancement provision and the enhancements do not kick in immediately, whereas the decline in the crime rate occurred immediately. As a result, ""three strikes"" proponents were forced to shift their explanation—the law deterred potential offenders.",1,15

Contrary to this claim, the authors found that the decline in the crime rate preceded passage of the law. Further, were ""three strikes"" the cause of a significant part of the decline, the rate of decline should have increased after its passage. Instead, the rate of decline remained constant, suggesting that the causes of the decline that were operating prior to the passage of the law continued to be the primary reason for the drop in crime rates.",1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"Empirical studies suggest that California would have experienced virtually all of its decline in crime without ""three strikes."" At the same time, ""three strikes"" will have a significant cumulative effect on the size of the prison population, an expense that will grow over time. One effect will be to increase the number of older prisoners, a group that represents a low social risk because most offenders become less criminally active as they age. Not only are older prisoners not likely to commit crimes if set free, but they cost the state much more to keep incarcerated than younger, healthier offenders.",1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"None of this comes as a surprise to many commentators who doubted the wisdom of ""three strikes,"" certainly as it was enacted in California. But none of us who opposed ""three strikes"" can take much comfort in knowing that our concerns were borne out. The important policy question is how can we reform the law to avoid its excesses?",1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"Few politicians were willing to oppose ""three strikes"" during its passage. And while most politicians in the past decade have feared being labeled as soft on crime, that fear was exacerbated during the legislation’s passage. Aided by the kidnapping and murder of young Polly Klaas, Mike Reynolds, the father of a murder victim, pushed the bill through the legislature with remarkable resolve. He was unwilling to compromise or allow amendments to the bill (or to a virtually identical ballot initiative). His sway with the legislature was extraordinary, with most afraid that if they opposed him, he would portray them as soft on crime. Since the law’s passage, passions have cooled somewhat. But one legacy of the charged political environment in which the law passed is that its amendment requires a supermajority. As a result, even those few politicians who are now willing to propose amendments face an uphill battle at best.",1,15

But outside of the death penalty context, that protection is more theoretical than real.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p font span  ,"Meaningful review of ""three strikes"" sentences might weed out many of the cases in which twenty-five-year-to-life sentences seem excessive. But two important questions remain. First, even the Ninth Circuit’s decisions may be severely limited in their scope. All three cases decided thus far have involved petty theft as the third strike offense. Under California law, petty theft is a ""wobbler,"" an offense that may be a misdemeanor or a felony. Under the circumstances of the cases before the court, the offenders’ records have led to the crime being treated as a felony. Once escalated to a felony, the crime becomes the third strike. The effect of the unique features of California’s sentencing laws is that what might be a misdemeanor ends up resulting in a life sentence. If the Ninth Circuit’s approach turns on that feature of the law, the impact of these cases is quite limited, perhaps to as few as 300-350 cases out of over thousands of ""three strikes"" cases. For example, if so limited, the Ninth Circuit’s approach would offer little hope for an offender whose third strike was a minor possession of narcotics or marijuana offense.",1,15
