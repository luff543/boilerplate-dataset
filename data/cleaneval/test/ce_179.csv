html body text div div span  ,"Throughout the campaign, the media have demanded that John Kerry detail a strategy for dealing with Iraq. Never mind that the situation has changed dramatically, month-by-month, throughout the campaign. Never mind that even if it were possible to propose a ""perfect solution"" for today's situation, that solution would be hopelessly out-of-date by January. Never mind that, no matter what the plan, the Bush Campaign would ridicule any element that it could not coopt. (That led to the recent pecularity, following Kerry's first clear speech on an Iraq plan, in which the unreflective Bush Campaign declared through parallel statements to the media, ""His ideas are the same as ours"" and ""He's advocating 'defeat and retreat'"".) Never mind that no similar demand has been made of the Bush Campaign.",1,6

Worse, it could push interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's fragile interim government toward the breaking point. One early warning sign was this week's comment by interim President Ghazi Yawar, a Sunni Muslim, criticizing recent U.S. airstrikes on Fallujah as ""collective punishment."" It was Yawar's threat to quit the interim government last April that helped halt the previous U.S. offensive in Fallujah.",1,8

html body text div div blockquote em span  ,"If you try to put yourself in the boots of a U.S. soldier in Iraq, what you want to know from the candidates is: Can we win this thing, and if not, how can we get out? Unfortunately, the debate didn't really illuminate those essential questions. The most difficult days in Iraq may well lie ahead, but neither candidate has leveled with the country about how severe that test will be, or what fallback plans he has if his assumptions prove overly optimistic.",1,8
html body text div div span  ,"The questions are not entirely unfair, but Ignatius again ignores the fact that what might work today might not work tomorrow, let alone next month. The answer to ""can we win this thing"" seemed a bit different when Bush was strutting beneath his ""Mission Accomplished"" banner than it does today - and the colossal mistakes made since that time make it much less likely that we will achieve the results we most desire. Then, ""winning"" was defined as creating a stable nation with a secular, democratic government. Today, ""winning"" seems to be defined as achieving stability, preventing civil war, and creating a government that is not hostile to western interests. Would Ignatius call a plan to achieve that end a plan for victory?",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Bush, the person in the best position to provide the type of answers Ignatius demands, won't provide them. His answers would be an admission of the failure of his central promises in the ""liberation"" of Iraq, and would also reveal that he has no ""exit strategy"". And his campaign can't simultaneously accuse Kerry of ""defeat and retreat"" while simultaneously proposing Bush's plan for doing precisely what he ridicules.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Bush would love for Kerry to paint a strategic picture on Iraq that addresses the present realities. ""See how negative and pessimistic he is. Defeat and retreat. He's setting back our interests in the region."" Columnists like Ignatius need to place the onus on the Bush Administration to announce its plan - to which the Kerry camp could then be called upon to respond with what it would do differently. And Bush knows that had he clearly enunciated his plan for Iraq and ""exit strategy"", he would have had to update the plan so frequently as to be (in his parlance) the quintessential flip-flopper, or would have had to repeatedly admit failure. Or both.",1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Perhaps, before being allowed to write columns like this, columnists like Ignatius should be required to propose their own plans to achieve victory in Iraq, and their ideas of a viable exit strategy. Perhaps such a demand would be the only thing that would wake them up to the realities of the situation, and why their demands are rather silly.",1,6

html body text div div span  ,"When I hear criticisms of Kerry as the Democratic candidate, I am often left wondering what it is that inspires those criticisms. That is, the speakers will declare something silly like, ""Kerry doesn't excite me"", or ""He was picked because he was considered the most electable"", as if... as if either statement has any significance, or as if parties should pick unelectable candidates. Or ""Bush reminds me of a guy I'd drink a beer with"", or ""I like his swagger and confidence - he's like me"" (which is pretty much what a blue collar attendee at a Nascar event said a few months back - as if Bush is",1,6

Whose idea is it that you should want a candidate you would drink a beer with, or that you shouldn't want a candidate who instead drinks wine and likes fancy food? Or that you should have an (unelectable) candidate who excites you, rather than a staid, intelligent, and competent candidate who seems, well, staid, intelligent, and competent instead of ""exciting"". The media, I suppose, started to buy into the packaging and selling of a candidate, over the substance and competence of a candidate, after the Nixon-Kennedy debates. So ""Dukakis looks silly in that helmet""-type nonsense often becomes the media's central focus, as opposed to the candidates' positions on the issues.

Very few lawyers engage in this type of litigation - on the one hand, fortunately, there aren't that many cases to be litigated in any given state; on the other hand, it is far too costly a gamble for those who can't afford to specialize in this type of litigation. Very few attorneys can risk $100,000.00 or more in up-front costs on a coin toss. And, although doctors may argue otherwise, very few attorneys would want to engage in this type of practice.",1,6

The same experts often make a very handsome living from their testimony alone, be it for the malpractice insurance carrier or the plaintiff. The jury is then asked to pick a side by a ""preponderance of the evidence"" - which is why I referenced the coin toss. Whether one side persuades the jury that the plaintiff only proved a 49% likelihood of malpractice or a 51% likelihood of malpractice may turn more on external factors - such as whether the defendant doctor seemed arrogant when he testified, or whether the plaintiff came across as a greedy opportunist - than on the evidence.",1,6

But when it comes to making the system better, doctors and their lobbyists are almost universally silent. They instead want to arbitrarily limit the damages received by the most seriously injured victims of malpractice, in the most meritorious of cases.
