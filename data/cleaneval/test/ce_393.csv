html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font font span  ,"Plowing of the rootzone followed by sun-drying up to two weeks of the clods improves the effect of the following leaching and puddling of the soil.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font strong font span  ,(with pump irrigation).,1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"Leaching and Puddling will require pump irrigation to make the soil sufficiently wet. Puddly and soft wet soil is a requisite to the growth of rice up to the end of the tillering stage. When the soil is puddly and soft there are relatively wide spaces between the soil particles, there is a low percentage of the solid phase and both bulk density and hardness are low. These conditions favour rice plant growth and absorption of nutrients. After a number of years, with repeated cycles of puddling, the formed plow-layer will encourage much better water control.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font font span  ,.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,Drainage of the rice field between the end of the tillering stage and the panicle differentiation stage will lead to higher yields. Rice roots will extend more deeply and stems grow more strongly. Drainage will increase the portion of the most active white roots of the rice plant and will decrease the number of non-active black roots. This drainage will also cause the soil to become more hard and compact by sun drying. According Cheng (1984) the presence of white roots against black roots is a good indicator that sufficient drainage has been applied.,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font font strong span  ,.,1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,The main aim for the water management is to promote leaching/percolation by controlled drainage during periods with rainfall. It will be difficult to provide sufficient water for 8 mm/day percolation. It appears that leaching is most essential during planting and early growth of the transplanted rice. Pump irrigation during this period should be highly recommended for real high yields. Water supply may include acid canal water as it has little effect on the yield and can be used to provide sufficient percolation.,1,13

These water level below surface does not affect the yields in these rice fields of the swamp lands. During periods with high rainfall mostly the groundwater levels will be higher.

The groundwater levels drop up to 30 cm below surface will not be necessary anymore in soils subject to several cycles of plowing, leaching and puddling with pump irrigation.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"Ripe soils are in advantage over less-ripened, soft soils for high yields. These soils can also be better puddled and are less subject to toxic conditions. Ripe soils in the swamplands will be formed after long periods of dryness during the dry season.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font strong font span  ,.,1,15
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"A long dry period in the dry season when groundwater levels drop below 60 cm depth will have a very positive effect on the next crop.The positive effect is attributed to better aeration of the soil, oxidation of toxic organic compounds and increased permeability by crack forming in the poorly drained clay soils. In wet years the drop of groundwater will hardly occur during the dry season. Therefore an field drainage system is required. For the Acid Sulphate soils it is essential that sufficient percolation can be applied after the dry season, during the next growing season. In these conditions the El Ni√±o effect of 1997/98 resulted in peak high yields for the following growing season in the Telang project of South Sumatra province.The same positive effect in acid sulphate soils has been recorded for the Saleh project (South Sumatra) in 1994/95, also after an extreme long dry season. Computer Model Simulations based on acid sulphate soil oxidation and leaching, also show that a deep drop of groundwater below the pyrite layer does not influence the toxicity in the next growing season, when normal percolation quantities (4-8 mm/day) are applied during the growing season of the rice.",1,13
