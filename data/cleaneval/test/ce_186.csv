html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,Are You A Representative of USC's Athletics Interest?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You are a representative of USC's athletics interests (commonly known as a ""booster"") if you have made a donation to the USC Athletic Department, are or have been a member of a booster organization associated with USC Athletics, or you have been involved in any way with promoting USC's athletic programs.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Once an individual is identified as an Athletics Representative, the person retains that identity forever!",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,Who Is A Prospect?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"A prospect is a student in the ninth grade and above, including students in prep schools, junior colleges, and individuals who have officially withdrawn from four-year schools. In addition, a student who has not yet started ninth grade may become a prospect if USC or a booster provides the student, or the student's relatives or friends, with financial assistance or benefits not generally provided to other students.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,What Is Recruiting?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,Recruiting is any solicitation of a prospect or the prospect's parent/legal guardian by a University staff member for the purpose of securing the prospect's enrollment at USC and/or participation in USC's intercollegiate athletics program.,1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Recruiting activities include correspondence, e-mail, faxes, telephone conversations and in-person contacts (both on and off campus).",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,Who May Recruit?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,Only coaches and Athletic Department staff may be involved in the recruiting process. The NCAA rules specifically prohibit boosters from engaging in recruiting activities.,1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You may not have any contact (i.e., in-person encounter, telephone call, correspondence) with a prospect or the prospect's family, on or off campus. If a prospect approaches you regarding USC, explain that NCAA rules prevent you from discussing USC with prospects. This prohibition also applies to prospects making official visits to USC.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You may not contact a prospect's coach, principal or counselor for the purpose of evaluating a prospect's athletic ability or academic record.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,You may not talk to a student-athlete at another institution for the purpose of encouraging him or her to transfer to USC.,1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,What May Boosters Do?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You may continue to have contact with an established family friend or neighbor who is a prospect. However, such contact may not be for recruiting purposes and may not be initiated by a USC coaching staff member.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You may bring outstanding prospects to the attention of the USC coaching staff by sending them newspaper clippings or other information about prospects. However, you may not be involved in the actual evaluation of talent. All evaluations and contacts are the sole responsibility of the USC coaching staff.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,You may offer assistance to members of USC's coaching staff who are recruiting in your community.,1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,Common Questions,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p b span  ,Q: The son or daughter of an old friend is being actively recruited by a USC coach. Do I have to stop having any contact with the prospect and his or her parents?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"A: No, you may continue to enjoy the same relationship with the family that you had before. You may not, however, use your relationship to urge that the son or daughter chooses USC, and you may not allow a coach to enlist you in the recruitment process.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p b span  ,Q: What should I do if I encounter a prospect while watching my son or daughter's high school athletic contest?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"A: The NCAA rules prohibit boosters from having in-person contacts with prospects. However, the rules recognize that a booster may inadvertently (without prearrangement) come into contact with a prospect. In this situation, the booster may exchange polite greetings with the prospect, but must then terminate the encounter. The exception does NOT apply if the contact occurs at the prospect's school, or at a site where the prospect is competing. In these circumstances, NO contact of any kind is permitted.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p b span  ,Q: May I attend a public event - for example; a community picnic or a high school banquet or awards dinner - if prospects are also in attendance?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"A: Yes, you may. Be sure, though, that you do not have any contact with the prospects.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,What Is An Extra Benefit?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"An extra benefit is any special arrangement to provide a student-athlete or the student-athlete's relatives or friends with a benefit not authorized by the NCAA rules. The NCAA allows USC to provide student-athletes with scholarships to cover tuition, fees, room, board and books. We can also provide complimentary admissions to USC athletic events, practice or competition-related apparel, equipment and medical treatment. It is a violation of NCAA rules for a student-athlete to receive any other benefit UNLESS the same benefit is normally available to all USC students or their parents/guardians.",1,11

html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,What May A Booster Provide?,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You may provide an ""occasional"" meal at your home for a student-athlete or an entire team if you live within a 30-mile radius of USC's main campus. You may also provide transportation to your home for the meal. The term ""occasional"" has been interpreted to be no more than once per year.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"You may provide a job to prospects that have signed a letter of intent to attend USC. For addition you may employ an enrolled student-athlete under certain circumstances with prior approval from the USC Athletic Department. Student-athletes who are not freshmen may receive employment income in certain situations. Both the student-athlete and the employer must sign a written statement PRIOR to beginning any employment during the academic year. Student-athletes may be compensated only for work actually performed and at a rate commensurate with the going rate in the area for similar services. The general limit on employment earnings that do not count towards NCAA limits is $2,000 annually, not including official vacation periods.",1,11
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span span  ,Common Questions,1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p b span  ,"Q: May I give a discount on clothing, food or car rentals to student-athletes as part of my business?",1,12
html body text end table tbody tr td div p span  ,"A: No. A discount that is specifically designed for student-athletes is considered an extra benefit and against NCAA rules.
