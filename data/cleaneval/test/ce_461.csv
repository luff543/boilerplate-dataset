html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Teaching conversational English is the service project in southern Italy. In the spring and fall, volunteers are needed to teach conversational English to elementary, middle school, or high school students under the direction of Italian English teachers in Manduria, Monopoli, Brindisi and communities surrounding Ostuni. You will assist in each day's classroom work using student texts and established lesson plans provided by the teacher. You'll also have opportunities to depart from the formal lessons. For example, you can serve as a resource on topics of North American culture, including discussions on history, daily lifestyle, sports, and school systems. Some volunteers also teach American songs and games, while others provide instruction on continuing dialogues and writing letters.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"In the summer, volunteers are also needed to teach conversational English in Ostuni, but you will conduct your lessons much more independently. These are intensive English language programs for children eight to 14 years old. Instead of teaching hand in hand with a local teacher, you and your teammates will work under the guidance of a single local coordinator who will want you to oversee your own lessons.",1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div div p font span  ,"English has become the international language of commerce and technology. Children and adults all over the world want to learn English as a tool for their future development. That is why the teachers and school administrators in the Pulgia region of Italy invited Global Volunteers to send volunteers to teach conversational English in 1995. The Italian English teachers are very good English grammarians and they are excellent teachers. However, English is their second, third or perhaps fourth language. Students want and need to learn pronunciation, idioms and syntax from native English speakers. With that said, it is apparent that sharing English conversation with a native speaker for only one or two weeks will not greatly enhance a student's ability to speak English. However, working with several native English speakers for many weeks each year - year after year - can have a tremendous positive effect. We know this is the case because the teachers keep inviting us back and enthusiastic students keep showing up for class, month after month, year after year. You can truly make an enormous difference in the lives of Italian students by teaching conversational English, even for just a week or two!",1,12
