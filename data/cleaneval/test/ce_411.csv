html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,he Awards and Recognitions page of Andrea Michaels� bio sheet reads like that of any legendary athlete or thespian. To say she has left an indelible mark on the event industry would be an understatement.,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Entering her third decade as an event planner and producer, Michaels has climbed to the top of her profession armed with a clear sense of purpose and an unwavering event philosophy that says if you take the time to truly understand the client�s intent, then you hold the key to creating a successful and memorable event.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"""I�m famous for saying, �Sell the client what they want to buy and not what you want to sell them,�"" she says. ""Every event has a purpose, even if it�s not an obvious one. And delivering that purpose successfully is the one and only true key.""",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Michaels� ability to conceptualize an event and then exceed customer expectations has been her hallmark and a primary reason why she has produced events around the world and coveted accounts, such as 20th Century Fox, NASA, Pepsi, Eastman Kodak, Mercedes-Benz and Microsoft, continue to contract her services.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Besides her proven track record, Michaels has a background in entertainment and holds a master�s degree in psychology�both of which play important roles when dealing with customers and planning events.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Michaels has said that she approaches each function as if it were a play, complete with an overture, acts and a finale. Like a theatrical production, a Michaels-produced event is designed to provide its audience with a sense of anticipation, building in excitement and enjoyment before finally ending with a distinct and satisfying conclusion.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"""I want each and every element of any project I�m involved in to have content and meaning and a personal experience for everyone in the audience,"" comments Michaels. ""In Vancouver (for the opening of GM Place), when the owners and managers of the arena said, �I want the audience to cry,� I remembered that in each and every element. The orchestration of what we did was so emotional and impactful that you could watch 22,000 people weeping as they stood and applauded. It was about how the entire event was constructed, flowing and building continuously until you could almost see hearts pounding with energy, excitement and, best of all, emotional investment. Just thinking about it still gives me chills.""",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Although she is admittedly her own worst critic, which is enough of a barometer to judge the relative success of any event with which she is involved, Michaels does have a simple formula for measuring achievement. ""Success is when the audience smiles, applauds and, best of all, years later�remembers.""",1,10

Street performers, stand-up comedians and stage actors are all drawn to the immediacy and intimacy a captive audience provides. They thrive on crowd-generated electricity and will sink or swim depending on people's instantaneous reactions. The same can be said for those involved in event planning and production. The hint of danger that every live event carries provides an adrenaline rush that would be the envy of Evel Knievel or any death-defying X-Gamer. Once they taste it, many can't shake it.

html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"The company has been a rousing success, in part, because it has never lost sight of the original ideals Morton instilled back in 1939. Then and now, the live experience is the very essence of any work the company performs for its clients.",1,10

html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Jack Morton Worldwide has grown to be a leader in experiential brand communications and continues to evolve by utilizing new areas such as mobile marketing and Webcasts. Regardless of the medium, whether coordinating broadcasts via the Internet or selecting music rolls for a player piano, the keys to creating a memorable event have remained remarkably similar to when Morton first started in that North Carolina theater: set measurable objectives, respect the brand and engage the audience.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Morton continues to champion the latter as the ultimate measuring stick for an event's success. At 92, the live experience still holds a powerful allure. ""The reaction of a live audience is real,"" he says.
