html body text div div div div div div div p big span  ,Want,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,to get a heated debate going among technologists? Ask them this question: Can the open source software movement defeat (or severely cripple) Microsoft in the marketplace?,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"With little academic attention focused on this question, Harvard Business School professors Pankaj Ghemawat and Ramon Casadesus-Masanell decided to dive in. Most research to date into the OSS movement has focused on the organization and management issues surrounding OSS. Ghemawat and Casadesus-Masanell chose to explore the fundamental competitive dynamics question: Will OSS ever displace traditional software from its market leadership position?",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"""We believe that there is still a great deal of confusion and puzzlement on how this competitive battle will develop,"" say the authors of the academic paper",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,Dynamic Mixed Duopoly: A Model Motivated by Linux vs. Windows,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,", which has just been accepted for publication in a special issue of",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,Management Science,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,.,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Ultimately, the authors believe, neither side is likely to be forced from the battlefield�Microsoft has too much market share and OSS offers too many benefits for users. But there are strategies each can use successfully against the other, as they detail in this e-mail interview.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p strong span  ,Sean Silverthorne:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,Why should OSS ever displace traditional software?,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p strong span  ,Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"One main advantage of open source software is that because users can modify the code directly (as they encounter problems or have new ideas on how to improve it), the development cycle is significantly shorter. Proponents of OSS claim that if this",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,demand-side learning,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"(as we call it) is sufficiently strong, OSS will oust traditional software. In addition, software engineers claim that the better architecture of most OSS projects make them a potentially superior product, adding to the probability of success.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"However, OSS has disadvantages too. Most importantly, it",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,comes from behind,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"in terms of market share (installed base). Because the value of an operating system depends critically on the number of users, traditional software has an advantage. Clearly, a larger installed base implies that there will be stronger direct and indirect network effects, and this will enhance the value of the operating system to current and potential users. In addition, a larger installed base also implies that there will be more feedback on bugs and more suggestions for new features.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Our paper introduces a dynamic mixed duopoly model in which a profit-maximizing competitor (Microsoft) interacts with a competitor that prices at zero (Linux), with the installed base affecting their relative values over time. We use a formal model to ask what conditions are needed for Linux to take over Windows. The questions that we address are: Is Linux's superior demand-side learning sufficient to win out? What is the effect of forced procurement by governments and some large corporations on the long-run equilibrium? How do cost asymmetries play out? Can Microsoft use piracy strategically to improve its market position?",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"From a managerial perspective, these are significant questions. If it turns out that OSS will incontestably displace traditional software, software firms need to adapt as quickly as possible to the new competitive landscape by, for example, incorporating some aspects of the open source development model, or else be ready to exit. In fact, the model suggests ways in which the likelihood of OSS winning out can be minimized (see below). If, to the contrary, OSS turns out not to be a threat to the traditional model, firms should not waste time and attention trying to figure out ways to fight this battle.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,Q:,0,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,Could you summarize your results?,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,A:,0,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"First of all, let us make a caveat regarding our approach. Our methodology is formal economic modelling. What this means is that we construct a stylized mathematical model of the relationship. The model captures what we believe are the most important features of the Linux-Windows competitive battle (faster demand-side learning on the part of Linux and an initial installed base advantage for Windows), but makes important assumptions regarding other aspects. Without these simplifications, the model would not be tractable and it would not be possible to obtain results. After having analyzed the base model, we relax some of these assumptions.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div blockquote span  ,Harnessing demand-side learning more efficiently,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div blockquote strong span  ,is not sufficient,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div blockquote span  ,for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows.,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Our main result is that in the absence of cost asymmetries and as long as Windows has a first-mover advantage (a larger installed base at time zero),",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,Linux never displaces Windows of its leadership position,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,". This result holds true regardless of the strength of Linux's demand-side learning. Furthermore, the result persists regardless of the intrinsically better design and potential differential value of Linux. In other words, harnessing demand-side learning more efficiently",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,is not,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows.,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Having obtained this basic result, we investigate the conditions that will warrant that Linux ends up forcing Windows out. We do this by modifying the model in two ways. First of all, we look at the effect of having buyers such as governments and some large corporations committed to deployment of Linux in their organizations. We call such buyers",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,strategic,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,". In addition to cost-related reasons, governments back Linux because having access to the source code allows them to verify that sensitive data is treated securely. Binary code makes it hard to figure out who has access to information flowing in a network. Companies such as IBM, in contrast, back Linux because they see in OSS one way to diminish Microsoft's dominance. We find that the presence of strategic buyers together with Linux's sufficiently strong demand-side learning results in Windows being driven out of the market. This may be one main reason why Microsoft has been providing chunks of Windows' source code to governments.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Second, we look at the role of cost asymmetries. In the base model we assume that the cost structures of Windows and Linux for the development, distribution, and support of software coincide. A natural question is then whether the central result that Windows survives in the long-run equilibrium regardless of the speed of Linux's demand-side learning persists if there are cost asymmetries. We find that because OSS implies lower profits for Microsoft, the larger the cost differences are between Linux and Windows, the less able Microsoft is to guarantee the survival of Windows.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"We also show that it is not all bad news to Microsoft. We analyze the effect of having forward-looking buyers and the presence of piracy, and conclude that both benefit Microsoft.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"We question the effectiveness of influencing forward-looking buyers' perceptions on the value of an operating system. The model suggests that the more forward-looking buyers are, the more advantageous it is to use fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) tactics to drive the competing system out. Consider SCO, a small ""vulture"" firm that had bought up the intellectual property rights to a particular version of Unix and threatened Linux users with lawsuits over infringement of those rights unless they agree to pay substantial licensing fees. IBM, which was one of the prime corporate sponsors of Linux as well as the target of a lawsuit by SCO that sought $1 billion in damages, alleged in mid-2003 that SCO was in cahoots with Microsoft. Our model indicates that if buyers are sufficiently forward-looking, such actions may jeopardize the ability of Linux to continue as an effective competitor in the operating system space.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"We also look at the effect of piracy and ask whether piracy can ever be beneficial to Microsoft. This extension was motivated by analyzing data on a cross-section of countries on Linux penetration and piracy rates. We found that in countries where piracy is highest, Linux has the lowest penetration rate. The model shows that Microsoft can use piracy as an effective tool to price discriminate, and that piracy may even result in higher profits to Microsoft!",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Finally, the paper investigates the societal welfare consequences of OSS availability by comparing different industry structures (monopoly and duopoly). We find that while a monopoly of Linux is always preferable (from the point of view of societal welfare) to a Windows monopoly, it is ambiguous whether a duopoly Linux-Windows is better than a Windows monopoly.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"The basic trade-off is the following: With a duopoly, more individuals and organizations use PCs because prices are lower, and this raises welfare. However, with a duopoly, no operating system ends up exploiting fully its potential because developers' efforts wind up divided between the two systems. However, with a monopoly, the efforts to develop new software and improve the platform are directed towards one system only and this may turn out to be better from a social welfare perspective.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,Q:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"In general, what surprised you about the results? What assumptions did you have going in that didn't hold up?",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,A:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"When we began the project, we thought that network effects and demand-side learning would result in Linux forcing Windows out. After all, we reasoned, if Windows is sold at a positive price and Linux is free, there will always be Linux users, and if the strength of Linux's network effect is large, the value of Linux to prospective users should eventually become larger than that of Windows.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Well� we were wrong (and this illustrates the usefulness of developing a formal model). What we had missed is that Microsoft's initial advantage (larger installed base) together with its pricing power allow the company to price strategically to control Linux's market share going forward. By lowering the price of Windows, the demand for Linux shrinks to the point where Linux is not a threat to the survival of Windows. The model also shows that a ""milking strategy"" (setting high prices in the short term and leaving the market at some point in the future) is not desirable to Microsoft. The reason is that if Microsoft follows such a strategy, as the last period becomes closer and closer, the relative benefit of abandoning it and lowering prices to survive a few more periods increases dramatically.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div blockquote span  ,The model shows that Microsoft can use,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div blockquote strong span  ,piracy as an effective tool,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div blockquote span  ,"to price discriminate, and that piracy may even result in higher profits to Microsoft!",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"The ""Windows persistence"" result turns out to be robust to different specifications of the model. In fact, in the first few months into the project we had developed several alternative models and every one of them yielded this very same finding.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"In addition to this main result, we were also surprised to find that piracy may end up increasing Microsoft's profits. To understand why, notice that there are two types of pirates: those who would not have bought Windows in the first place because it is too expensive, and those who would have bought Windows but now decide to pirate it. The first category increases Windows' installed base without affecting sales. As a consequence, this group increases the value of Windows. And thanks to these pirates, Microsoft is able to set higher prices in the future (because the value of the system goes up). In addition, having these pirates means that Linux's installed base does not grow as much as it would have if piracy weren't there. The second type of pirates (those who in the absence of piracy would have bought Windows) reduces Windows' sales and profit. Thus, if the proportion of first-type pirates is sufficiently large, Microsoft's profits will increase with piracy.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Finally, the social welfare result that a Windows monopoly is not always worse than a Linux-Windows monopoly was also unexpected. This questions the social desirability of policies aimed at guaranteeing Linux's survival.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,Q:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,You mention in the paper that the model is not to be taken as a literal model of the Linux/Microsoft competition. But can you say anything about why Linux has enjoyed success against Microsoft?,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,A:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Linux's success against Microsoft is still relative. In the client space, Windows is the undisputable leader, and in the server space, Linux and Windows have both been gaining positions for the past ten years. The big losers are Novell, Unix, Solaris� everybody except Linux and Windows.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Despite this, Microsoft is visibly concerned about Linux's upsurge. The Halloween memos (see",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p a span  ,http://www.opensource.org/halloween/,0,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,") are an obvious testimony of this concern: ""OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat to Microsoft, particularly in server space. Additionally, the intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that are not replicable with our current licensing model and therefore present a long-term developer mindshare threat.""",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"Microsoft has a great deal to lose if Linux wins the operating systems battle. Microsoft is a software company, and a defeat in operating systems would point to the vulnerability of its entire business portfolio. In addition, the operating systems group is one of Microsoft's biggest revenue generators. Moreover, to a large extent Microsoft's sustained success over time in such a dreadfully rugged landscape has been due to its dominant position in operating systems. It is well known that Microsoft won the browser wars leveraging its dominant position in client operating systems. And the same will happen in the media player space unless the American or European antitrust authorities prevent it. We expect Microsoft to put all its ammunition to fight this battle.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,Part of the reason why Linux has made significant inroads is the determination of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation to have a,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,free,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,(as in,1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p em span  ,free,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"dom) operating system. According to Stallman, application software will never be truly free unless there is a free operating system that supports it. Thus, since the moment Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman joined forces, a big chunk of the foundation's efforts have been directed at building a free operating system.",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,Then there are some large corporations and governments backing the development of Linux. These players use Linux as a way to curb Microsoft's dominance. This support is important because there are tedious portions of the code that would rarely be developed spontaneously by members of the Linux-developer community.,1,12

html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,"From your modelling, what can Microsoft do strategically to remain competitive against a product that is argued to be of better quality, is updated more frequently, and is free?",1,12
html body text div div div div div div div p b span  ,A:,1,13
html body text div div div div div div div p span  ,A few actions that the model suggests Microsoft could do to remain competitive are:,1,12

As the OSS/free software movement gains momentum and developers foresee that victory is within reach, they increase their effort to accomplish this. Third, because most OSS projects have a log file listing all contributors to the code, some developers find it desirable to participate in OSS projects to signal their ability and to enhance their chances of promotion and professional advancement.
