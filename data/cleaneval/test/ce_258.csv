html body text i span  ,Blueberries are a popular early summer small fruit. Successful blueberry marketing requires that thefruit not only be of very high quality but that it also be properly packaged and thoroughly cooled.This publication explains the postharvest handling procedures necessary to deliver North Carolinablueberries of the highest quality.,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Most consumers purchase fresh blue-berries on impulse and are prompted primarily by the perception of quality.Wholesale buyers also associate appearance and firmness with fruit quality and freshness. Successful blueberrymarketing thus requires that the fruit be of the highest quality and appearance. However, blueberries are extremelyperishable and easily damaged by rough handling and adverse temperatures. Because blue-berries are often harvestedand handled during hot, humid weather, attention to proper postharvest handling is essential to maintaining quality.",1,5
html body text h2 span  ,Harvesting,1,5
html body text span  ,Blueberries of the highbush type (,1,4
html body text i span  ,Vaccinium corymbosum,1,5
html body text span  ,L.) and the rabbiteye type (,1,4
html body text i span  ,Vaccinium ashei,1,5
html body text span  ,"Read) are grownin North Carolina. More than 90 percent of the blueberries produced commercially are of the highbush type. Harvestingof highbush blueberries begins in late May and often continues through late June. Rabbiteye varieties ripen in lateJune, and harvesting continues into August. Blueberries, even those growing on the same bush, do not all ripen at thesame time. Under normal growing conditions, blueberries ripen over a period of three to four weeks. Ripe blueberriesshould have a completely uniform blue color. Fruit with a red tinge are less mature and will not be as sweet as moremature berries even though they ship well and will turn completely blue within several days. Depending upon the cropand the weather conditions, blueberry fields may be harvested as many as four times in intervals of five to seven days. For rabbiteye varieties the interval between harvests may be as long as nine daysin cool dry weather. Harvesting more frequently may not make efficient use of labor, whereas less frequent harvestingmay result in a high percentage of overripe fruit.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"In general, high temperatures during blueberry harvest season promote ripening. Heavy rains during periods of hightemperature can further hasten ripening, cause splitting, and greatly reduce storage quality. When picking labor islimited, prime fruit may easily become overripe. Overripe blueberries are extremely easy to damage. Blueberries that don t look too bad when picked may be totally unacceptable when they reach the consumer. Be careful! Price, andparticularly reputations, depend largely on quality. Once damaged, your reputation and that of your marketingorganization may be very difficult to repair. Consumers long remember experiences with a poor quality product.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Whenever possible, avoid harvesting wet blueberries. Wet berries are very susceptible to decay organisms and oftenresemble overripe berries leaking juice. Waiting a few hours to begin harvesting after a rain or heavy dew cansignificantly reduce the chance of infection by postharvest disease organisms and can improve the appearance of thefruit.",1,5
html body text h3 span  ,Manual Harvesting,1,5
html body text span  ,"Proper instruction and careful supervision of the picking crew is essential to the success of any harvestingoperation. Postharvest quality control begins in the field. Packing house problems and buyer complaints are often theresult of poorly trained and supervised pickers. Have a responsible person supervise the pickers at all times. If thefruit is harvested directly into pint cups, it is a good idea to check one or two pints at random in each flat. Thischeck can be made easily by emptying the contents of a pint cup into a shallow pan where each berry can be examinedindividually. Finding more than 6 to 8 percent poor-quality fruit per pint indicates a need for greater qualitycontrol.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Ripe blueberries are easily removed from the bush. Fruit should be removed with the thumb and forefinger, keepingthe hand cupped under the berry to avoid dropping it. The whitish, dusty appearance (bloom) of the blueberry is highlydesirable, and consumers regard it as a sign of quality. Overhandling the berries will remove the bloom. In addition,all workers should be reminded that they are handling a food product that is eaten fresh and often not washed. Cleanhands and sanitary personal habits are required at all times.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Harvested blueberries should never be allowed to remain in the sun. The dark berries will readily absorb heat. Ifberries are picked into buckets, the buckets should be no larger than 5 quarts and of rigid construction to minimizemashing and the accumulation of respiration heat.",1,5
html body text p b span  ,Rules for Blueberry Pickers,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Keep your hands clean. Remember that you are handling a food product. The law requires you to wash your hands after each visit to the rest station.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Pick all the ripe blueberries on the bush before moving on to the next bush.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Harvest only well-ripened fruit. Leave immature fruit for the next harvest.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Place your hand under the clusters to avoid dropping the berries.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Avoid overfilling your hands; do not squeeze or roll the fruit.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Do not put trash or cull berries into the container.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Never allow harvested fruit to remain in the sun.,1,6
html body text h3 span  ,Mechanical Harvesting,1,5
html body text span  ,"Recurring labor problems have prompted some blueberry growers to investigate mechanical harvesting. The majoradvantage is a significant reduction in management and labor costs. Savings in labor costs of 30 to 45 percent have beenreported. One mechanical harvester can replace as many as 100 manual pickers. Over-the-row mechanical blueberry harvesters havebeen available since the mid-sixties. These machines have been primarily of the shake-and-catch design, which detachthe blueberries by shaking or vibrating the bush. The fruit drops onto a capturing device and conveyor, on which it ismoved past an air-blast cleaner and finally into field lugs.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Even if carefully adjusted and operated, mechanical harvesters will harvest a significant amount of unacceptablefruit. These machines have no means of detecting quality and will harvest immature, overripe, diseased, and damagedfruit that would ordinarily be discarded by a human picker. The elimination of this unacceptable fruit and foreignmatter is difficult and expensive, and it requires that the berries be handled excessively. A mechanical harvesterand the required sorting machines often subject the fruit to excessive damage. Overripe fruit, in particular, is easilydamaged by these machines. Any additional handling adversely affects the shelf life and quality of the blueberries.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Although a significant percentage of the blue-berries grown worldwide are harvested by machine, most NorthCarolina growers strive to produce fruit for the higher-valued fresh market. Mechanically harvest-ed blueberries aregenerally considered unfit for the fresh market and are therefore usually frozen for processing.",1,5
html body text p b span  ,Rules for Minimizing Damage to Fruit by Mechanical Harvesting,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Harvest only dry fruit in the coolest part of the day.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Minimize the drop heights on the machine and pad the impact surfaces.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Eliminate as much vibration as possible.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Limit the depth of harvested fruit in the field containers to 4 or 5 inches.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Handle and dump field containers very gently.,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,Cool the fruit as soon as possible after harvest.,1,6
html body text h2 span  ,Sorting and Packing,1,5
html body text span  ,"Sorting harvested blueberries intended for the fresh market is time consuming, expensive, and damaging to thefruit. Therefore, this practice is generally not recommended. The best time to remove defective berries is duringmanual harvesting, thus minimizing handling. For machine-harvested blueberries, there may be no alternative but toremove trash and defects on a grading line. When a grading line must be used, it should be operated in such a way as tominimize mechanical damage.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Whether blueberries are mechanically or manually harvested, every effort should be made to keep the percentage ofdefective fruit to an absolute minimum. Seriously defective fruit may include those with insect damage, broken skin,decay or mold, attached stems, fruit remaining in clusters, and fruit that is overripe, underripe, shriveled, or off-color. U.S. Number 1 is the only specified grade for harvested blueberries. Blueberries grading U.S. Number 1 may haveno more than 1 percent serious defects and no more than 13 percent total defects. However, in practice and especiallywith fresh-market blueberries buyers may require less than 5 percent total defective fruit.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Most buyers prefer large fruit over small fruit if they are of good quality. The U.S. Number 1 grade specifies thatthe count of berries per 1/2-pint container must not exceed 250. Within the U.S. Number 1 classification there are foursize classifications, as listed in Table 1.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"Almost all North Carolina fresh-market blueberries are marketed in cellophane-covered pint containers shippedin 12-pint master containers known as flats. Flats may be conveniently stacked, six to a layer, on a standard 40-by-48-inch shipping pallet (Figure 1). A pallet of blueberries customarily consists of 96 flats (1,152 pints) with a grossweight of approximately 1,200 pounds.",1,5

html body text h2 span  ,Cooling,1,5
html body text span  ,"At warm field temperatures, harvested blueberries are extremely perishable and decline rapidly in quality. Visiblesigns of decay organisms can develop on warm, wet blueberries in less than 12 hours. The most common blueberrypostharvest decay organisms in North Carolina are",1,4

html body text span  ,(Alternaria rot) and,1,4
html body text i span  ,Botrytis cinerea,1,5
html body text span  ,"(graymold). In situations where blueberries are wet and the risk of decay is high, a rinse in chlorinated water (75 to 125ppm available chlorine) has been successful in controlling these diseases. However, chlorination is a preventivemeasure only. It will not salvage fruit already infected because it cannot kill microorganisms that are already belowthe surface. Moreover, chlorination cannot be used for fresh-market fruit because the chlorine completely removes thebloom and bleaches the fruit.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Decay organisms are very active when the fruit is warm but become much less active at lower temperatures. Warm,overripe blueberries, leaking juice from rough handling, provide an ideal site for various postharvest decays. Shelf-life experiments with packaged blueberries have demonstrated the dramatic reductions in decay possible with rapid andthorough cooling. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of cooling in reducing decay.",1,5
html body text p b span  ,Figure 2. Percentage of decay in packaged blueberries stored at various temperature.,1,6
html body text p span  ,"Harvested blueberries should be cooled as soon as possible but always within 4 hours of harvest, if possible. Thismay require more than one pickup or trip to the cooling facility during a day of harvesting. However, the increase inshelf life and overall quality will make it worthwhile. No fruit, particularly well-ripened fruit, should ever be heldall day without cooling.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Blueberries remain alive after harvest, respiring and producing heat. At a temperature of 80 F, blueberries canproduce as much as 22,000 Btu per ton per day from the heat of respiration. Unless this heat is removed by cooling, itcan cause a rise in temperature of as much as 6 F. Cooling lowers the respiration rate, slowing the ripening processand the accompanying inevitable decline in quality. The respiration rate of blueberries at 80 F is nearly 20 times therate at 40 F. In other words, blueberries held at 40 F have nearly 20 times the shelf life of those held at 80 F. Softeningis the most visible physiological damage resulting from overripening.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Most North Carolina blueberries in wholesale channels receive some cooling. However, a portion may continue toreach the consumer in poor condition as a result of insufficient cooling. Often the effectiveness of cooling, not itsavailability, is the deciding factor in quality. Cooling must be thoroughly and consistently applied to be effective.The optimum temperature that will ensure the longest shelf life is just above freezing: 33 or 34 F.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"A pallet of packaged blueberries, initially at 80 F, allowed to remain for an hour or so in a cooler without forcedventilation may appear to have cooled somewhat. However, only the blueberries on the outside will cool appreciablyin that length of time. Temperature measurements taken inside cellophane-wrapped cups near the center of palletsstanding in still air at 44 F have actually shown a slight temperature increase during the first hour of cooling.Calculations suggest that the center cups of pallets of 80 F blueberries would require more than 36 hours to cool tobelow 50 F. Pallets of hot blueberries allowed to stand in a cooler for several hours before shipment without forcedventilation will not be cooled significantly nor uniformly. Furthermore, numerous tests have shown that refrigeratedtransports provide little or no additional cooling.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"In still air, the average cooling rate of pallets of blueberries is slow because heat is transferred from theinterior only by conduction. The cellophane wrappers, the fiber cups, the paperboard flats, and especially the airgaps between the cups act as effective insulation, slowing the movement of heat. This fact has prompted shippers ofmany commodities to install equipment inside the cooler to force the cold air through the containers, greatly increasing the cooling rate. In existing refrigerated rooms not equippedwith fans, the addition of fans (Figure 3) to move the air is the single most cost-effective change possible, providedthat the refrigeration system has sufficient capacity to remove heat rapidly.",1,5
html body text p b span  ,Figure 3. Fan arrangement for forced-air cooling of blueberries,1,6
html body text p span  ,"Blueberries cooled with forced air reach the desired storage temperature significantly faster than those in stillair. In addition, they cool more uniformly. Figure 4 shows typical average pulp temperatures for a pallet ofblueberries in still air and for a pallet in forced air. Forced-air cooling is clearly much more rapid than cooling instill air. Depending on the circumstances, the rate of cooling may be 16 to 20 times faster.",1,5

html body text p span  ,"Forced-air cooling gives more consistent and thorough cooling through the entire pallet load. In situations wherea considerable investment has already been made in refrigeration equipment and buildings, an additional nominalinvestment in one or more forced-air cooling fans can dramatically reduce the time required to cool blueberriessatisfactorily, resulting in the delivery of a consistently higher quality product to the consumer.

html body text span  ,"Although blueberries are grown commercially in about a dozen states, the major supply areas are Michigan, NewJersey, North Carolina, and the Pacific Northwest states. Over the last decade, domestic per capita consumption ofblueberries has continued to expand at an average annual rate of 4 percent. In 1991, consumption of fresh blueberriesreached 1/4 pound per person; consumption of processing blueberries (in canned and frozen form) was nearly 1/2 poundper person.",1,4
html body text p span  ,"Domestic blueberry supplies are most readily available during June, July, and August, with July being the peakharvest month. In the past, North Carolina producers have enjoyed a timely marketing advantage because they oftenharvest their berries in mid-May and June, earlier than many other competitive supply regions. Recently, however,increased plantings of highbush varieties in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas have intensified early-seasonmarketing pressures. In addition, more plentiful late-summer low-bush supplies are available from Canada.",1,5
html body text p span  ,"Local grower prices for blueberries have varied considerably over the past decade, with sharp price declinesobserved in 1985 and 1990. As the supply of high-quality berries continues to increase, local growers should continuetheir efforts to provide high-quality, properly cooled blueberries to buyers in order to maintain and expand theirmarket share.",1,5
