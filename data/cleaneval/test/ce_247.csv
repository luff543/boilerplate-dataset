The Moon has so many features and details that if you observed it each possible night for the next decade, you wouldn't see everything.

Individual features about that month's astronomy highlights (such as eclipses), the planets, deep-sky observing, meteor showers, comets, and asteroids will provide you with plenty of ideas about what to observe. Ongoing (but not monthly) features such as ""Moon observer's notebook"" and ""A deep-sky year"" provide additional projects that go into a bit more depth for beginning observers.",1,21

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"One of the most pleasurable observing experiences you can have under the summer or winter sky is simply scanning the Milky Way with your telescope.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"You can double your potential observing time if you purchase a quality solar filter and observe the Sun. You must be very careful when observing the Sun. Never look directly at the Sun with the naked eye or with any unfiltered optical instrument, and always cover your finder when observing the Sun. That being said, there are a number of safe ways to observe the Sun.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"A filter that fits over the objective of the telescope is called a pre-filter. If you use a pre-filter, be absolutely certain it cannot be dislodged accidentally by the wind or by being bumped. If you are in doubt, securely tape the side flange of the filter to the telescope tube. When I construct a mounting cell for a solar pre-filter, I always include a large thumb screw that secures the cell to the tube.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Start your solar observing by counting sunspots. Apart from being fun, sunspot counts provide a gauge of solar activity. Numbers of sunspots have been recorded on a daily basis since the middle of the 18th century.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"The Moon is a brilliant object when viewed through a telescope. You actually may want to use a neutral density filter to reduce the Moon's light. A better method is to do what many observers do to help them observe the Moon in comfort: Turn on nearby white lights when you're observing the Moon between First Quarter and Full. The addition of white lights suppresses the eyes' tendency to dark adapt at night and, in fact, causes the eye to use normal (scotopic) vision, which is of much higher quality than dark-adapted (photopic) vision.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Of the 1,940 named features on the Moon, 1,545 (nearly 80 percent) are craters. There are many more craters in the highlands than in the maria. The size range of craters is large, and some observers make it a personal challenge to see either (1) how small a crater they can see, or (2) how many small craters in a given area they can observe with a particular telescope. A detailed map of the Moon is, of course, a necessity for a project of this type.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"When observing larger craters, note whether you can see ""rays"" emanating from them.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Next to the Sun and Moon, the celestial object with the greatest detail is Jupiter. Even small telescopes will show Jupiter's four largest satellites. They appear as bright stars on either side of Jupiter and are generally in a straight line (although some interesting triangles and other forms are possible).",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"In addition to the moons, several dark stripes can easily be seen on the planet. These stripes, on either side of the equator, are known as the North and South Equatorial Belts. With larger telescopes operating at greater magnifications, more belts are visible.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"At higher magnification, you can see that Jupiter is flattened, a result of its rapid rotation rate coupled with the fact that it is not a solid planet. Jupiter's equatorial diameter is more than 5,000 miles larger than its polar diameter.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Watching Jupiter night after night can be a rewarding pursuit. In addition to the changing positions of its moons, the planet's rapid rotation brings nearly all of its visible area into view in a single night. At times, individual belts and zones become more or less prominent. Some have even disappeared for extended periods of time.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"All observers should use filters to bring out fainter detail not visualized in integrated (white) light. A blue (e.g., Wratten 38A) filter will enhance the dark reddish-brown belts over the planet. A red (e.g., Wratten 23A) filter will bring out the blue features (festoons) within the Equatorial Zone (EZ) of Jupiter as well as the northern and southern borders of the major belts.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Jupiter is a great object to sketch. Sketching will make you a better observer because you'll study small areas more intently. Two words of caution when sketching Jupiter: Draw quickly! Jupiter rotates quite rapidly, and some of the features you'll be sketching may rotate out of view if you take longer than about 20 minutes. Sketch the positions of the equatorial belts and polar regions first. Carefully estimate their widths and extent and where, in terms of latitude, they begin and end. Next, place the less apparent belts and zones on your sketch as they appear on the planet. Work on one hemisphere at a time. Next, place features within the belts and zones using Jupiter's central meridian (an imaginary line from top to bottom) to help you gauge the distances. Finally, carefully shade your sketch to duplicate what you see. One technique some observers say works to bring out additional detail on Jupiter is to focus the eye on a spot halfway between one of the poles and the equator — but don't actually look at the spot. Concentrate on seeing and sketching detail in the polar area. Repeat for the other hemisphere.",1,21

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Astronomers estimate that 60 percent of all the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy are double or multiple stars. These stars appear as one to the unaided eye, but many may be resolved into pairs with the help of a telescope. I don't think there's an amateur astronomer I know who doesn't enjoy observing double stars. It's fun, easy, rewarding, doesn't take a complicated setup, you can observe from within a city, and challenging objects exist for every size of telescope.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"In addition to where the double star is in the sky and how bright each component is, there are two quantities with which a double star observer should be familiar. The first is the ""separation"" of the pair. This number is given in arcseconds, and it is simply the distance between the two stars. The second quantity is the ""position angle."" This is the angle, measured from north through east, of the fainter of the pair (the ""companion,"" or ""secondary"") from the brighter (the ""primary""). For instance, if the companion is due north of the primary, its position angle is 0°. If it is due east, 90°, and if midway between south and west, 225°.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"To determine the directions in your field of view, just let the stars drift for a while. If your telescope has a motor drive, turn it off for this check. The stars will enter the field of view from the east and exit to the west. Determine the longest path for the stars you see drifting through the field. This is your east-west line. The north-south line is perpendicular to it, and to find it, turn the drive back on, center a reasonably bright star, release the declination lock on your drive, and move the telescope by hand toward the north. As you observe the field of view, the bright star will be heading out, toward the south. Reverse this if you are located in the Southern Hemisphere. The technique is only slightly more complicated if you own a telescope on an alt-azimuth mount. To move this type of telescope ""north,"" you have to adjust the altitude and azimuth motions simultaneously.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"The size of your telescope will influence which double stars you observe. The resolution of a telescope only depends on its size. Double star observers often refer to a rule of thumb called ""Dawes Limit."" The formula for Dawes Limit is r = 4.56/D, where",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div i span  ,r,1,22
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"is the separation (in arcseconds) of the closest resolvable double star, and",1,21

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div i span  ,D,1,22
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"is the diameter of the objective in millimeters. And remember, Dawes Limit is only a guideline.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"One reason for the popularity of double stars is that many of them show color. Colorful double stars are a joy to behold. It does take some time at the telescope before you begin to see colors easily, but the payoff is big. Close double stars often help us see color. The contrast between two or more stars in close proximity brings out subtle color tones that normally would be lost if each was viewed separately.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Some of the enjoyment in amateur astronomy is in sharing observations with friends. You will find, however, that color perception at the eyepiece is about as personal and subjective as any phase of our hobby. Colors that you see apply to your eyes, period. Consider the following example. Once, at an observing session, my friend Steve Coe of the Saguaro Astronomy Club of Phoenix, Arizona, mentioned that he saw the double star 107 Aqr as white and light green. His friend Gerry Rattley immediately stepped to the eyepiece and, after a moment, asked, ""Which star are you calling green, the orange one?""",1,21

In 1974, from the reasonably well-lit campus of the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, a friend and I logged 106 Messier objects in one night using his 6-inch Newtonian reflector.
