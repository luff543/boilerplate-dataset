html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"FTW - October 9, 2001 � Although uniformly ignored by the mainstream U.S. media, there is abundant and clear evidence that a number of transactions in financial markets indicated specific (criminal) foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the case of at least one of these trades -- which has left a $2.5 million prize unclaimed -- the firm used to place the �put options� on United Airlines stock was, until 1998, managed by the man who is now in the number three Executive Director position at the Central Intelligence Agency.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Until 1997 A.B. �Buzzy� Krongard had been Chairman of the investment bank A.B. Brown. A.B. Brown was acquired by Banker�s Trust in 1997. Krongard then became, as part of the merger, Vice Chairman of Banker�s Trust-AB Brown, one of 20 major U.S. banks named by Senator Carl Levin this year as being connected to money laundering. Krongard�s last position at Banker�s Trust (BT) was to oversee �private client relations.� In this capacity he had direct hands-on relations with some of the wealthiest people in the world in a kind of specialized banking operation that has been identified by the U.S. Senate and other investigators as being closely connected to the laundering of drug money.",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td font span span  ,Krongard joined the CIA in 1998 as counsel to CIA Director George Tenet.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font span span  ,"Before looking further into these relationships it is necessary to look at the insider trading information that is being ignored by Reuters, The New York Times and other mass media.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font span span  ,"�Selling Short� is the borrowing of stock, selling it at current market prices, but not being required to actually produce the stock for some time. If the stock falls precipitously after the short contract is entered, the seller can then fulfill the contract by buying the stock after the price has fallen and complete the contract at the pre-crash price. These contracts often have a window of as long as four months.",1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div center table tbody tr td p font span span  ,"�Put Options,� are contracts giving the buyer the option to sell stocks at a later date. Purchased at nominal prices of, for example, $1.00 per share, they are sold in blocks of 100 shares. If exercised, they give the holder the option of selling selected stocks at a future date at a price set when the contract is issued. Thus, for an investment of $10,000 it might be possible to tie up 10,000 shares of United or American Airlines at $100 per share, and the seller of the option is then obligated to buy them if the option is executed. If the stock has fallen to $50 when the contract matures, the holder of the option can purchase the shares for $50 and immediately sell them for $100 � regardless of where the market then stands. A call option is the reverse of a put option, which is, in effect, a derivatives bet that the stock price will go up.",1,21
