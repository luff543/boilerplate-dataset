html body text div div div div div span  ,SVEN ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE US.. WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE CUP,1,9
html body text div div div div div span  ,18 October 2003,1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,SMOTHERED beneath all the ugliness of the past few weeks is a ray of hope that should be cutting through English football's gloom more clinically than a Bruno Heskey right hook.,1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Lay aside the brawls, roastings, hearings, missed drugs tests, and wannabe Scargillites for a second. Banish from your head the terrifying prospect of thousands of yobs currently booking flights to Faro for anarchy away-days. And focus for one second on this indisputable fact:",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,England are going to Portugal next summer with their best-ever chance of winning a major championship outside of this country.,1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"If you don't believe me, or if you refuse to entertain such optimism for fear of sounding like a sad Baddiel and Skinner clone, then allow me, as Bruno might say, to fill you in.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"For all the muck that has been hurled at Sven Goran Eriksson these past three years, he is now probably the most successful international manager in world football.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"The only other coach holding a candle to his one defeat and 13 wins in 19 competitive games is France's Jacques Santini who won all eight of his Euro 2004 qualifiers. But with the opposition consisting solely of Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia and Israel, it hardly invites comparison.",1,9
html body text div div div div div div span  ,Advertisement,0,10
html body text div div div div p span  ,"If Eriksson is still in charge, the knowledge, talent respect and stability he takes to the finals will be priceless. I wouldn't disagree with anyone who thought he was out of line for staying mute during last week's shenanagins, but look at the result.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"The team spirit was sky high against Turkey, which never would have happened had he sided with the FA. I doubt if Glenn Hoddle or Kevin Keegan would have failed to back their employers, but I know what Sir Alex Ferguson would have done.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,He would have encouraged a siege mentality and told his men to go and ram the bile back down their critics' throats.,1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"It's why, like Fergie, the players trust and respect Eriksson. Because he stands by them and rarely chops and changes to suit public taste.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Sir Alf Ramsey was like that, which was how he bred an awesome team spirit that took his England all the way.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Interestingly, it is by examining Eriksson's lowest point in charge, the defeat against Brazil in Japan, which fires the optimism for Portugal.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"The difference in the teams that day, apart from Brazil being far more used to the heat, was that their world-class players performed and England's didn't.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Michael Owen, despite scoring, was carrying a hamstring problem that killed his pace. It was that game that taught him to embark on a gruelling weights programme that would clear up that injury. And it has.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"David Beckham was far from fit either. He had been rushed back from his broken foot and it showed, not least in the tackle he jumped out of which gifted Brazil the equaliser.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Steven Gerrard was absent too, and how they missed his still unbeaten record for his country. He is maturing into one of the best midfield players in the world and in Portugal he will prove it.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Wayne Rooney wasn't there either, but next June he will be eight months closer to manhood, aching to show the world what he has already shown his country. That he was born to grace football at the highest level.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"There is a long time to go, and a lot more drama to unfold. But if these five men - Eriksson, Owen, Beckham, Gerrard and Rooney - perform at their best next summer, then England will be the team to fear.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Mainly because this young side fears absolutely no-one as the results against Germany, Argentina and twice against Turkey show. Next summer they will be older, better and even more fearless.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Besides with Eriksson's record, and a ranking of sixth in the world, with France and Spain the only Europeans above them, who should they fear?",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Portugal will be good but under intense pressure not to fail, Spain are eternal under-achievers, we have battered Germany, seen Wales beat Italy, and France have been in decline for three years.",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"England will not be the most technically-gifted team out there, but as the Germans consistently show, why worry about that when you have a coach, a system, a few world-class players and luck. And who is luckier than Eriksson?",1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Looking back over Eriksson's extraordinary reign I can't think of a more fitting epilogue than him ending 38 years of hurt, saying, thank you, it's been a pleasure gentlemen, then walking away to the sound of his critics choking on their words.",1,9

html body text div div div div p span  ,"But above all else this man was football's gift horse of the century.
