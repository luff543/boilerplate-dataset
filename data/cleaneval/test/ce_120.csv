html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div table tbody tr td div b span  ,POLITICAL DIARY,1,20
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div table tbody tr td div span span  ,By Nick Assinder,1,20
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div table tbody tr td div span span  ,"Political Correspondent, BBC News website",1,20
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font b span  ,Daily despatches from the House of Commons,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font font span  ,1215 GMT 30 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"If Tony Blair really wants to crack down on anti-social behaviour, perhaps he could take a leaf out of Singapore's book.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Hacks travelling to the island for the Olympics 2012 announcement have been warned they must not take more than one pack of cigarettes with them and there is a list of the few places where smoking is allowed.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Even better, they have been told chewing gum is only permitted on medical prescription.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"And to put the cap on it all, they have been reminded that spitting in public is also an offence.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Now you're talking.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1030 GMT 29 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Chancellor Gordon Brown made an interesting speech to the Fabian Society at its summer party on the Commons terrace.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font table tbody tr td div div span  ,Signs from above for Brown,1,19
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"After all the usual stuff about Africa, the election, etcetera, etcetera, he suddenly slipped into campaigning mode and started talking about the (for which most read ""his"") ""historic fourth term"".",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The Thames boiled, the heavens opened, rent asunder by slashes of lightning and thunderous claps of, er, thunder.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,What could it all mean?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1230 GMT 28 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,One of the great symbolic modernisations of the Tories under Michael Howard was to move the party out of its old Smith Square headquarters into a glistening new office over Starbucks.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Apart from giving the party an up-to-date image, the aim was to flog off the Smith Square building to raise cash for party coffers.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Except no one wants to buy it. Apparently the fading and warren-like interior needs a thorough makeover.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,So much so that one insider whispered the party may even have to move back in.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,What sort of message would that send out?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1130 GMT 27 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Would-be Tory leader Alan Duncan may be unmarried and have no children, but he has found a ""family"" to care for over the past few days.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,St James' Park is close to his Westminster residence and one of the ducks recently delivered a fine clutch of chicks in his garden.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Three of the ducklings hardly had time to squeak before they became Magpie food, but three have survived and, I'm told, have become the apple of Mr Duncan's eye.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Now he can't wait to get home each evening to check up on his new charges.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1230 GMT 23 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has always had a certain way with words.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Remember the ""quiet man"" who then ""turned up the volume"".",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Well he's at it again - this time in relation to his pet project the Centre for Social Justice.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The latest press release announcing some awards made by the body declared: ""Think-tank turns do-tank"".",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1630 GMT 21 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,One of the great mysteries of the general election campaign was over exactly who it was who phoned Home Secretary Charles Clarke on his mobile when he was standing on stage alongside the prime minister during the Labour manifesto launch.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The incident brought some much-needed light relief to the proceedings which, you may remember, resembled TV's The Weakest Link.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Well, Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has finally confessed, during a lunch for political journalists, that it was her. Or, more accurately, it was her ageing driver, Eddie, who was ferrying her around during the campaign.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"He was provided with a car, mobile phone and satellite navigation system for the campaign, but had absolutely no idea how to use the sat nave kit.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,As he was driving the minister to the manifesto launch at London's Mermaid Theatre he became hopelessly lost. So Ms Kelly borrowed his phone to contact her friend Charles Clarke who guided them to the venue before the event kicked off.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Unfortunately when it was time for the driver to return to pick up his passenger he once again became lost.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Luckily he still had the mobile phone and knew how to use the redial last number button - much to Mr Clarke's embarrassment.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1530 GMT 20 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"At the start of last week's EU summit, before tempers snapped and personal insults started flying across the Channel, the prime minister was happy enough to aim a small joke in Jacques Chirac's direction.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Asked about the French President's attendance at the looming G8 summit in Gleneagles, Mr Blair said he was happy to announce M Chirac would be there.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"But he only persuaded him to come by reassuring him he would not have to wear ""le kilt"", joked Mr Blair.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Er, well that's not quite how it has turned out. It now appears the President expects to remain in Singapore to celebrate Paris' expected victory in the 2012 Olympics bid - so will miss the first day of the summit.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Indeed, there are even those suggesting he will stay in Singapore even if Paris doesn't win, just to embarrass the prime minister. Unless, of course, London wins.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1230 GMT 16 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Most people would be understandably flattered to discover they have been included in a reference work.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,But Commons leader and former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon was probably less than delighted when his Tory opposite number Chris Grayling pointed out he had made it into a dictionary.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Unfortunately it is the online cockney rhyming slang dictionary which declares Geoff Hoon can now be taken as slang for baboon, as in ""you're a right Geoff Hoon you are"".",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"I should be careful about pointing this out Mr Grayling - your name does, after all, rhyme with failing.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1500 GMT 15 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Baroness Margaret Thatcher may not have quite the pulling power she once did - but there are clearly those who still carry the torch.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font table tbody tr td div div span  ,Thatcher still has her fans,1,19
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"One of the events during a dinner to mark the 30th anniversary of her election as Tory leader was an auction to raise cash for the hosts, Conservative Way Forward.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Top prize was a cup of tea on the House of Lords' terrace with the great Lady herself.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The bids just kept on coming - and ended with the lucky winner pledging a stunning Â£6,100.00 for the privilege.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Do I hear any bids for a skinny latte with the prime minister?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1200 GMT 11 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,It's been a pretty good week for Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Not only has all the talk about leadership challenges in the wake of his less-than-hoped-for election performance evaporated, but one of his political predictions appears to be coming true.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Firstly, and you can be forgiven for not noticing, he has been re-elected as party leader - if that is the right phrase in the absence of an actual vote or challenge.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Secondly a new opinion poll has suggested that public support for ID cards has started to slide dramatically from around 80% to 55%, just as Mr Kennedy has always claimed it would.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Now one poll may not signify anything, but it comes amid growing whispers that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is desperately seeking a way of averting a Commons defeat over the issue when it comes back before MPs in the next couple of weeks.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"And if that happens, as with Iraq, Mr Kennedy will claim he is the only party leader to have consistently opposed the policy.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1200 GMT 10 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The government is, as we all know, committed to freedom of information - and it expects all Whitehall departments to do their bit.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Even the once hugely-secretive Ministry of Defence is on board and has part of its website devoted to telling people how to use the system to get the information they want.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Unfortunately for one colleague it didn't quite work like that.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,First he rang the MoD to ask about how to obtain information under the FOI rules.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The switchboard attempted to put him through to a number which did not work.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,So he was given another number to dial himself. That connected to one of those infernal disembodied voices which directed him to yet another number.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,When that was dialled he was greeted with the message that the number could not be recognised. At which point he gave up.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Only a temporary tickle on the freedom front I'm sure.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1300 GMT 9 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"A bit late in the day perhaps, but I have only just heard of a great wheeze deployed by ex-Tory election boss, Lynton Crosby, to keep morale high among the party's staff during the election campaign.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"He handed out daily prizes for all sorts of things other than simply good performance. For example, on one occasion the award was for the best mobile phone tone.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The budget for this scheme was quite low, however, so the prizes were modest, but imaginative, and were sometimes awarded for only a day.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The bottle of beer was, understandably, non returnable, but the booklet of the ""60 most appalling lefties"" had to be returned once read.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"More alarmingly, so did the Union Jack G string. Whether it was put to use before being returned for re-awarding is a question too far.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"At the end of the campaign it was retrieved from the last winner, framed and handed back to Mr Crosby with a note of thanks signed by party staff.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1300 GMT 8 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"One of the more pleasant events of the parliamentary calendar is the journalists' reception for new MPs, which took place last night.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"This tradition is aimed partly at showing the new intake what a thoroughly friendly, trustworthy and sober bunch we all are.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,But it is hard not to get the impression that some of the MPs have come along simply to put a face to the names of those they expect to be their future tormentors - or at whose hands they believe they may have already suffered.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Still, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and, hopefully useful event.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"As the splendid chairman of the press gallery, John Hipwood declared at the end of his welcoming speech to the MPs: ""Remember, we are here to help.""",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1445 GMT 7 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Staff and MPs returning from the short Whitsun recess have been greeted by signs telling them where they are no longer allowed to smoke.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,No great surprise there as there has been a continuing programme of gradually turning the Palace of Westminster into a smoke free zone.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,But what surprised and even angered some was the rule banning people from lighting up outdoors if they were in sight of members of the public.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Presumably the powers that be think it would not present the right image to tourists visiting the mother of parliaments to see little knots of people hanging around the precincts shrouded in clouds of smoke.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The rules state quite bluntly that any member of staff found puffing away in front of the public will be reported to their line manager. Persistent offenders will face disciplinary action.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,It is not clear whether these restrictions apply to MPs - they would never seek privileges ahead of members of staff would they?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Still I would love to witness the first occasion one of the security staff attempts to stop an MP lighting up in full view of the public.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1530 GMT 6 June,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"They will never admit it, but there are those in the government who are revelling in Jacques Chirac's discomfort over his country's ""No"" vote on the constitution.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Relations between Britain and France have always been on a rollercoaster and there have been some serious fallings out over the years.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,And there are many in the Foreign Office and Downing Street who find President Chirac both arrogant and overbearing.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Could this have anything to do with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's refusal to pronounce the EU constitution well and truly dead?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"One very senior FCO figured whispered: ""We will leave it to Mr Chirac to kill off the constitution. That will be exquisite.""",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"So, diplomatic relations back to normal then.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1230 GMT 26 May,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,This will either delight or terrify you - but Norman Tebbit has cloned himself.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font table tbody tr td div div span  ,Could there ever be another Tebbit?,1,19
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,"The ex Tory Chairman, once branded the ""Chingford skinhead"" and before whom lesser politicians cowered, has stepped into the row over Michael Howard's leadership.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Asked who he fancied as the next Tory boss, he revealed he had had himself cloned.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The carbon copy Tebbit is currently too young to take over the job, he declared, but his moment would come.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,So which youngster on the Tory benches has this particular big beast's DNA running through him?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Probably not the current MP for Chingford - one Iain Duncan Smith.,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font div span  ,1200 GMT 25 May,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Let's start the new Parliament with a poser. Exactly what is it with Tony Blair and blue frogs?,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font table tbody tr td div div span  ,Has Blair got frogs on the mind,1,19
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,When the prime minister announced election day all those weeks ago he was wearing a rather fetching red tie with blue frog motif.,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Nothing particularly odd about that. Either he was doing it to win a bet or more likely, as any father will instantly confirm, because it was a present from one of his children - presumably whichever has the most well developed sense of humour.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"But wait, what's this. The very same tie made another appearance on the day the prime minister was returned to Downing Street for his dreamt of historic third election victory.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Is this superstition, does the blue frog have magical powers, is there some hidden symbolism?",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The most famous, or infamous, blue frog is the unsurprisingly named blue poison arrow frog found only in a remote area of the South American rain forest.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"It is known as highly territorial, aggressive and, needless to say, poisonous to its enemies.",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,Or is there a more mundane explanation? Almost certainly.,1,14
