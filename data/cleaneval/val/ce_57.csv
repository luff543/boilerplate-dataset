Assad, Jr. is surrounded by the same type men who are lying to him by telling him â€œevery Syrian and Lebanese loves you!â€? It is typical of dictators to have that kind of people around them to make them feel good about themselves! My advice to Assad, Jr. is to do his best to allow the Syrians to express themselves freely. One more analogy, the Japanese car makers in the late 1970s allowed their employees to provide opinions and suggestions about how to design and build cars. In few years, they improved the quality of their cars and lowered its cost which led them to control the US auto market! The big three companies in Detroit refused to change and their share of the US auto market plummeted! Look around you, read history and learn from it Dr. Assad before YOU become history!",1,12

html body text div div div div div dl dd p span  ,"We in Lebanon are very disappointed that the EU did not include a conditional clause concerning human rights and the fate of the Lebanese detainees in syria in particular, for the conclusion of the syrian EU agreement. The EU constitution blabs endlessly about human rights and yet, when it comes to practice, it is conveniently oblivious to the atrocities committed by many middle eastern regimes, assad's being on top of the list. Sadly, this matter often finds little support about the people of the middle east themselves, either out of ignorance or out of plain indifference to a phenomenon they have come to view as collateral damage to the regimes in power. I would like to turn the attention of syrian citizens to the plight of teh lEbanese mothers and spouses whose sons have been the victim of forced disappearance by the assad regime for the last 25 years or so. The lucky ones get to see their sons once in a blue moon after significant bribes are paid to various syrian officers. Others cannot even find out if their sons are still alive. Of course we are aware that syrian citizens themselves are also victimized by the assad regime but we rarely hear a voice of support or concern..",1,12
