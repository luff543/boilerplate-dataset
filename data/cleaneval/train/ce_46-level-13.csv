html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,If any Democratic Senators are looking for a way to shine light on the Downing St Memo(and I'm not holding my breath) this may be the way to do it. And the beauty of it is that they can use that loudmouthed cretin John Bolton to do it:,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"A former Bolton deputy says the U.S. undersecretary of state felt Jose Bustani ""had to go,"" particularly because the Brazilian was trying to send chemical weapons inspectors to Baghdad. That might have helped defuse the crisis over alleged Iraqi weapons and undermined a U.S. rationale for war.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,[...],1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,The Iraq connection to the OPCW affair comes as fresh evidence surfaces that the Bush administration was intent from early on to pursue military and not diplomatic action against Saddam Hussein's regime.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"An official British document, disclosed last month, said Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed in April 2002 to join in an eventual U.S. attack on Iraq. Two weeks later, Bustani was ousted, with British help.",1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"After U.N. arms inspectors had withdrawn from Iraq in 1998 in a dispute with the Baghdad government, Bustani stepped up his initiative, seeking to bring Iraq - and other Arab states - into the chemical weapons treaty.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"Bustani's inspectors would have found nothing, because Iraq's chemical weapons were destroyed in the early 1990s. That would have undercut the U.S. rationale for war because the Bush administration by early 2002 was claiming, without hard evidence, that Baghdad still had such an arms program.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"In a March 2002 ""white paper,"" Bolton's office said Bustani was seeking an ""inappropriate role"" in Iraq, and the matter should be left to the U.N. Security Council - where Washington has a veto.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"Bolton said in a 2003 AP interview that Iraq was ""completely irrelevant"" to Bustani's responsibilities. Earle and Bohlen disagree. Enlisting new treaty members was part of the OPCW chief's job, they said, although they thought he should have consulted with Washington.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"Former Bustani aide Bob Rigg, a New Zealander, sees a clear U.S. motivation: ""Why did they not want OPCW involved in Iraq? They felt they couldn't rely on OPCW to come up with the findings the U.S. wanted.""",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote blockquote span  ,"Bustani and his aides believe friction with Washington over OPCW inspections of U.S. chemical-industry sites also contributed to the showdown, which went on for months.",1,11

People who work for wages, particularly those lower on the scale, are simply not in control of their lives in the same way as are those who work for themselves or those who are independently wealthy. From being treated like a lackey by the boss to having to answer to your mother-in-law because she loaned you money for the down payment, there is a slight, and sometimes not so slight, corruption of your freedom every time you are dependent upon another individual's goodwill.

The infringement on personal freedom that is most immediate and constant in most people's lives is having to brownnose another human being or play fast and loose with the rules because their financial survival depends upon it.

That's why I don't much like money, in a general conceptual way. It has corrupted friendships, family, jobs and relationships in ways that nothing else in my life ever has. It can and is used as a weapon as often as a tool.
