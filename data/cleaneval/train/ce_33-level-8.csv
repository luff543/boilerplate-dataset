I don't see why palpatine helping would make it less so, as it just adds another level to it (and takes more of the human element out of anakin's failure not to mention further complicates the ""prophecy"".)

In one interview, I recall Kurtz saying that only Leia would survive and she would end up in Episode XII as the ""People's Quen"" after the Emperor had been deposed. Darth Vader was always going to die in Episode VI (and possibly Luke with him), but the Empire would exist for some time after, albeit in a reduced form. The prequel trilogy would be largely disconnected from the other movies, with the first film set generations before the rest of the story, dealing with the foundation of the Jedi Order.

He narrowed down his focus by reading SF novels and Marvel Comics, and possibly Joseph Campbell as well, but probably more Castaneda. I suspect the theme of kids redeeming the father probably didn't occur to him until well in the pre-production of Empire, and I seriously doubt Leia was even going to be a blood relation until sometime between Empire and Jedi, regardless of the rumors about Fisher wanting a bigger role. In short, most of the transcendent themes were things Lucas came up with after 1977 and applied retroactively to the saga through the magic of filmmaking and the gullibility of fans who couldn't accept that he'd improvised most of the storyline.",1,7

I'm not sure to what extent Kurtz was involved creatively (though his absence is felt in ROTJ), but I always got the feeling that he saw the SW saga as more of a grand tragic epic with a decades-long story arc than Lucas' fairy tale in space conception. In one interview, I recall Kurtz saying that only Leia would survive and she would end up in Episode XII as the ""People's Quen"" after the Emperor had been deposed. Darth Vader was always going to die in Episode VI (and possibly Luke with him), but the Empire would exist for some time after, albeit in a reduced form. The prequel trilogy would be largely disconnected from the other movies, with the first film set generations before the rest of the story, dealing with the foundation of the Jedi Order. But there's no real evidence to substantiate any of these claims, and Kurtz was probably just drawing on conversations he'd had with Lucas back in the '70s.",1,7

So I cut it in half, but it was still too big, so I cut each half into three parts. I then had material for six movies. After the success of Star Wars I added another trilogy, but stopped there, primarily because reality took over. After all, it takes three years to prepare and make a Star Wars picture.

html body text div div div span  ,"It's nothing new from Lucas; the political subtext was there from the beginning, though it got submerged as the movies went on. The Emperor was conceived of as a Nixon figure, a crafty politico turned paranoid and inaccessible, and there was always the idea of a technologically superior military force being thwarted by primitive indigenous guerillas, like the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam. (Remember, Lucas was originally going to follow up American Graffiti with Apocalypse Now, so the Ewoks were probably his way of exploring that theme after losing control of the project to Coppola.) In one of the deleted scenes of Luke and Biggs on Tatooine, Biggs expresses concern that the Empire will draft Luke into service. Star Wars is definitely a product of the Watergate era, but it came out during the Carter administration, so everybody associates it with the goofy, hedonistic late '70s. By the '80s, Reagan and his speechwriters were using Lucas' imagery as a metaphor for the Cold War, something he probably never anticipated or desired. He never got over the use of ""Star Wars"" as a collective term for orbital missile defense. In Ep. I, Lucas repays Reagan in kind by naming the perennially befuddled and dim-witted Trade Federation leader Nute Gunray; the ""Nute"" comes from Knute Rockne All American, one of Reagan's best-known films, and as for ""Gunray,"" just transpose the syllables. For a guy who celebrates forgiveness and reconciliation, Lucas can sure hold a grudge; after all, he named the second banana bad guy in Willow after Pauline Kael, who bashed Star Wars back in 1977, eleven years earlier.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"I would be genuinely surprised if most viewers made any sort of connections between the storyline in Ep. III and current events, mainly because it sounds as though the political aspects of Palpatine's rise to power are dowplayed in favor of balls-to-the-wall action. (Besides, as we all know, Lucas had it planned out in advance all along, so any parallels are purely coincidental.) In all likelihood, there will be one or two batshit crazy right-wing Medved types who label Lucas a traitor after making all those good movies about upholding conservative values, but most people won't care or notice. And they'd be wrong about Lucas' politics, too; despite being insanely wealthy, he still seems to regard himself as a radical experimental filmmaker and unreconstructed liberal who managed to beat the Man at his own game, acquiring his independence one marketing license at a time. (Insert sarcastic comment about billionaire entertainer lecturing about the dangers of attachment and materialism here.) But even if he wanted to make Ep. III overtly political, I doubt he'd be canny or subtle enough to pull it off, even in a dorky Star Trek kinda way.",1,7

html body text div div div span  ,"Yeah, it's not so good, but it's not a disaster. This one is particularly frustrating for me, though, because it has entire moments and scenes that DO play, that work emotionally, thematically, or whatever, but are constantly being undermined by glaring problems: poorly written/delivered lines, moments of weird, choppy, meaningless editing (Ben Burtt fucks this movie backasswards just like Clones), small scenelets that are over before they start (the 2nd act is plagued by this), and just mismanaged stuff that could have been great, or at least passable.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"It's just so painfully obvious that Lucas' reach exceeds his grasp. There's some great non-verbal bits set to music: I loved the clones turning on the jedi across the galaxy, beautiful score, and a real sense of loss, but it's pretty contextless. Similarly, he goes for this Coppola-esque Birth of the Twins/Birth of Vader intercutting that's really magnificent all by itself (Padme's screams during labor cutting to the absolutely wrecked Anakin screaming as his limbs are re-attached) but it belongs in a different, better movie. He breaks his own SW rules all over the place in this scene (there's actually a POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a frightening isolation chamber being in the suit is).",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"McDiarmid is nasty, campy fun, just as he was in ROTJ, and everyone else pretty much acquits themselves admirably. McGregor has fantastic moments, but also many, many others, where he clearly just can't take this bullshit seriously anymore (see his lines to Dooku before they fight). Portman and Christensen are much improved, especially Christensen, who I think does an admirable job with an almost unplayabe character. Who knows why anyone in this movie does anything, other than puppetmaster Lucas.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"I thought that much of the duel was really good, actually, contrary to the Chud crew consensus. I actually thought that bar a few lines, the last fourth of the film was a hint of the A-game that Lucas could have brought to the whole deal, back in the day, had he cared to. He clearly took his time with certain sequences (the purge/assault on the temple, the massacre/baptism, oops I mean ""Birthing"" sequence), and he pretty much went ahead and neglected the connective tissue that makes such sequences make sense, just like in the last film.",1,7

html body text div div div span  ,"This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my inner 11-year-old shudders as I type this): it's better than ""Star Wars.""",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,...,1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"But every picture, however ravishing, needs a story, and the best way to appreciate how well this one succeeds is to consider the obstacles it must surmount in winning over its audience. First of all, though there are a few surprises tucked into the narrative (which I won't give away), everybody knows the big revelation of the end, since it was also the big revelation at the end of the previous trilogy: Darth Vader is Luke's father. We also know, for the most part, which of the major figures are going to survive the various perils they face. So an element of suspense is missing from the outset.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"More than that, the trajectory of the narrative cuts sharply against the optimistic grain of blockbuster Hollywood, in that we are witnessing a flawed hero devolving into a cruel and terrifying villain. It is a measure of the film's accomplishment that this process is genuinely upsetting, even if we are reminded that a measure of redemption lies over the horizon in ""Return of the Jedi."" And while Mr. Christensen's acting falls short of portraying the full psychological texture of this transformation, Mr. Lucas nonetheless grounds it in a cogent and (for the first time) comprehensible political context.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"""This is how liberty dies - to thunderous applause,"" Padmé observes as senators, their fears and dreams of glory deftly manipulated by Palpatine, vote to give him sweeping new powers. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is about how a republic dismantles its own democratic principles, about how politics becomes militarized, about how a Manichaean ideology undermines the rational exercise of power. Mr. Lucas is clearly jabbing his light saber in the direction of some real-world political leaders. At one point, Darth Vader, already deep in the thrall of the dark side and echoing the words of George W. Bush, hisses at Obi-Wan, ""If you're not with me, you're my enemy."" Obi-Wan's response is likely to surface as a bumper sticker during the next election campaign: ""Only a Sith thinks in absolutes."" You may applaud this editorializing, or you may find it overwrought, but give Mr. Lucas his due. For decades he has been blamed (unjustly) for helping to lead American movies away from their early-70's engagement with political matters, and he deserves credit for trying to bring them back.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"But of course the rise of the Empire and the perdition of Anakin Skywalker are not the end of the story, and the inverted chronology turns out to be the most profound thing about the ""Star Wars"" epic. Taken together, and watched in the order they were made, the films reveal the cyclical nature of history, which seems to repeat itself even as it moves forward. Democracies swell into empires, empires are toppled by revolutions, fathers abandon their sons and sons find their fathers. Movies end. Life goes on.That's a solid three stars at the very least. Interesting that Scott thinks the middle-is-the-end chronology of the two trilogies works... that it not only works, but resonates with the whole 'Force' theme of Star Wars.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"I'm a little encouraged by that review. It's a better explanation for liking the film than 'Darth Vader's in it!' and 'Wow, it looks just like the original Star Wars at the end!' On the other hand, I wonder if Scott is just a little giddy over the idea that Lucas is putting George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth.

Sidious murders his master in his sleep and takes over the Anakin plot himself. That's what I got from it. And assuming Palpatine is lying and did the whole scheme himself seems like a pointless assumption. ""Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie.""? Not good enough.
