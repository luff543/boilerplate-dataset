html body text table tbody tr td ul li span  ,Increased time to problem resolution,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If you are a developer, you probably face a number of development challenges on a daily basis. There's a constant need to keep current on emerging technologies, pressure from your customers to deliver products ahead-of-schedule, and a desire to build robust and scalable architectures.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Despite understanding the importance of performance to the success of any application, and the attempting to design and architect your application to ensure that it's robust and scalable, performance management is probably more of an after-thought and doesn't become a critical issue until production when the customer experiences a problem.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If you had a very simple application, it might not be too difficult to diagnose the problem. But, you're probably using Web services, JMS, Servlets, EJBs, and other distributed technologies. When you're given a support request such as, ""the application is slow"", you're most likely spending countless hours trying to identify and diagnose the performance problem. You won't have enough information to know where to even start, which will make it very difficult to recreate the problem outside of production.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"This leads us to the developer's dilemma. If you want to spend more type playing with new technologies such as grid computing or AOP, or you want to build more functionality, you have to balance that with the requirements to support the application.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div div span span  ,Time spent troubleshooting and fixing application issues...is time not spent on new functionality,1,15
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Consider the ""traditional"" approach commonly used to deal with performance issues. We are all familiar with the tried-and-true ""printf"" approach for measuring method call times. This technique can be quite useful, except when you have to correlate individual method times with an end-user experience. Spreadsheets and calculators can be your friend here, but it can be very time consuming.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"You might also be able to leverage a variety of operating system tools to help diagnose the problem. If the production machine is hitting 100% CPU utilization, you might leverage a tool such as glance to analyze the problem. Or, if you're experiencing thread contention or Java memory issues, you might leverage specific JVM tools to identify the bottleneck. Often, these techniques are too bottoms-up, making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand how any single component might impact the end user's experience.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If you're lucky, you may have had the opportunity to work with some simple management tools. Maybe you're leveraging the WebLogic administration console to get some application server statistics. Or, you might have even toyed with ARM, JMX, or Log4J. Even in these situations, the tools at your disposal often only provide part of the answer, and you are left to piece the puzzle together to resolve the problem.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Bottom line, many of the current approaches used to diagnose performance problems are often very time-intensive, requiring hours or days to diagnose. Many times, the problem isn't even related to the application. It could be a network issue or a database issue, but you've just wasted three days supporting the application instead of enhancing it.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,Where are the source code level performance bottlenecks?,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"OVTA from HP helps you isolate application performance problems in your J2EE applications. Rather than spending the time adding those printf statements, stepping through your code, and trying to identify exactly where your performance bottleneck is occurring, you can now use a tool that can provide you with all kinds of information about your application's performance.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"OVTA captures end-to-end transaction information and tells you if your transactions are flowing smoothly across the different application tiers, including the client, the web server, the app server and the database tiers. It will show you right down to the J2EE component, the location of the performance bottlenecks in a given transaction.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Now, we can all make mistakes in our code, especially if we're on a time crunch or are simply on a roll and hammering out code deep into the night. Once we have our code developed, how do we determine whether it contains a memory leak or a thread contention problem? Better still, how do we track the leak back to the source code and fix the issue? With the OVTA Java Diagnostics (JD) tool, we can quickly determine if our application is experiencing any memory leaks, and where any source code level performance bottlenecks are located.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Now you can do all of this in matter of minutes. Instead of spending a half-day stepping through various aspects of your code, trying to piece together the performance puzzle and making guesses on where the performance bottleneck might be, you can use OVTA to quickly diagnose the performance problems in your application.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Isolating the performance problem using HP OpenView Transaction Analyzer,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Let's take a look at how we can isolate an application performance problem in our application using OVTA.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"In this particular scenario, an IT operator or the application owner is monitoring the application for availability and response time. They might be using a product such as HP OpenView Internet Service (OVIS) to monitor the application from end-to-end to determine overall availability and performance. Here, we see a screenshot of this product indicating that the response time of our application is not in an acceptable state. As the operator or support specialist does some quick root cause analysis, he finds that it is your application that isn't performing up to defined service levels. He contacts you immediately and asks you to look at a problem that is occurring with your application. He doesn't tell you much except that your application transaction response time rate is twice the accepted rate. So how are you going to solve this problem? Let's now take a look at this problem through the perspective of OVTA.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td ul li span  ,JMX metrics to monitor WebLogic Server health,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"In the demonstration, transaction data was correlated across all of the application tiers. This is particularly important when you are trying to assess the exact component causing the bottleneck, including network or database issues that are beyond your control. This can cut the diagnostic time down to just minutes so that you can quickly address the problem.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"HP also offers OVTA Java Diagnostics, a profiling tool that allows you to perform application level analysis on running J2EE applications. The tool enables operations staff and developers to work together effectively in diagnosing performance bottlenecks, helping to diagnose memory leaks, source code performance problems, and other JVM issues.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Additionally, the impact of having OVTA monitoring and tracking the performance of your application is very low. At a high level, the product provides sufficient data to monitor the application with negligible overhead. You can also tune the amount of trace information captured when performing diagnostics. And even then, the overhead can be controlled to stay at very acceptable ranges while the problem is assessed.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"OVTA offers broad platform and application support, supporting HP-UX, Solaris, Windows, and Linux, and is capable of supporting both J2EE and .NET platforms. The product is optimized to support the WebLogic platform. Additionally, the product leverages JMX technology to monitor and assess the overall health of the WebLogic server. Metrics such as JVM memory utilization can be used to correlate the health of the server with the performance of your application.",1,9

html body text table tbody tr td ul li span  ,"Instrument the application, if required",1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,We have just looked at a way to diagnose J2EE application performance problems using OVTA. One way to deal with these issues is to have the right sets of tools on hand to diagnose problems when they occur.,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"But, what if you could design your application in such a way that it contains sufficient information to be better managed in operations? Today, operations relies on the developer because the information available to them is not sufficient to handle the problem themselves. If you can make your applications more ""management aware"", you can hopefully minimize the demands IT support places on you.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Additionally, designing applications with ""management in mind"" has some clear benefits to your organization. With the right set of management interfaces exposed by an application, and operator can ensure a higher degree of application availability. Manageable application can also be made more flexible and adaptive in production.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"What can you do to make applications more manageable? The good news is that many application platforms today provide some amount management out-of-the-box. Almost all J2EE platforms, including WebLogic, expose management interfaces for the platform in the form of JMX MBeans. These interfaces can then leveraged by management systems such as HP OpenView.",1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"In some cases, platform-level management is not sufficient to effectively manage an application in production. Some amount of work might be required by the developer up-front to expose application-level management interfaces.",1,9
