html body text div div div span  ,"During a warm-up race for the Tour de France (I believe it's called the Dauphine Libere), Mayo beat Lance by nearly 2 minutes in a mountain time trial, and Mayo went on to win the race. His big question, is his team strong enough to carry Mayo for 3 weeks? Can his team do well enough in the team time trial? I've heard this year there was a rule change that limits the time loss in the team time trial to something like 2 and a half minutes.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"Tyler Hamilton came in 2nd in Dauphine Libere, including beating Lance up the mountain time trial (35 seconds back of Mayo). He also won a 5 stage race in Switzerland earlier this year (I believe it's called the Tour de Romandie).",1,7

html body text div div div span  ,"Honestly, I do wonder if Lance can win this year.

html body text div div div span  ,"Vino is not on the T-Mobile start list, and neither is Cadel Evans, one of their better climbers. Still, the three best teams this year should be Postal, Hamilton's Phonak team, and T-Mobile. Phonak has looked really strong this pre-season, and they should contend for the team time trial stage. The tour organizers put a 2min limit on the TTT loss for this years tour, so that will help riders like Mayo and Heras. Heras also has another former USPS teammate on his roster, Christian Vande Velde, which will definitely help him in the smaller mountains and the TTT.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"The Dauphine results were a little skewed because Armstrong wanted to take it easier than the last few years (he won it in 02 and 03) because last year he crashed during one of the stages and was supposedly still in pain from that during the start of the Tour. Apparently he got a time check during the Mont Ventoux TT and saw that Mayo and Hamilton were already flying, so he took it easier for the remainder of the climb. The Alpe d'Huez TT in this years Tour is going to be amazing to watch, it will definitely be alot closer than the Dauphine TT. It is probably the stage I'm most looking forward to seeing.",1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"The day after that, like nanookfan said, will be killer. Long, with two or maybe three (I don't remember) HC climbs ending with a mountain top finish on the HC climb Plateau d'Beille. That has the possibility of being an epic stage, especially with the mountain TT the day before and some riders still spent from that.",1,7

So folks, don't panic early on. Also people are worried about the Sheryl Crow distraction and the ad shoots, etc. I believe that Lance is the most focused athlete of our time, cycling comes first.
