Although each of us goes through the experience of being diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer differently, there may be some common issues that you will need to deal with either immediately or long after our treatment is over. Having an awareness of the possibilities puts you in a better position to know how to deal with them or where to turn for help if one arrives in your life.",1,11

html body text table tbody tr td font p font b span  ,I have breast cancer and had been taking hormone replacement therapy. Should I continue to take it?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Your doctor should advise you about whether to continue HRT (hormone replacement therapy) at the time you are diagnosed with breast cancer. Generally, hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font b span  ,Why would hormone therapy be given to women with breast cancer?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Researchers have found a way to use hormones as therapy against breast cancer. This is different than HRT (hormone replacement therapy), which is given to imcrease levels of hormones (such as estrogen and progesterone) that are decreased in the body due to menopause.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"One hormone therapy drug for breast cancer is Tamoxifen. By blocking estrogen, Tamoxifen can block the growth of cancer cells. If your tumor is estrogen receptor positive (called ""ER positive"") this may be a good treatment for your breast cancer. (Estrogen receptors are found in the nucleus or center of the tumor cell. The ER allows cells to use estrogen to grow). Tamoxifen can be used alone, with chemotherapy, or following chemotherapy. Tamoxifen is also being used to prevent breast cancers from developing.

html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What is lymphedema?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Lymphedema is the collection of lymph fluid that can occur in your arm and hand after your lymph nodes have been removed or damaged from your underarm area (axilla) during breast cancer surgery.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What is lymph fluid?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Lymph fluid is a colorless fluid containing the white blood cells that fight infection and disease. Lymph fluid travels through channels of the lymph system throughout your body much like blood travels through arteries and veins.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What are lymph nodes?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Lymph nodes are small, pea-sized organs located along the lymph channels. They are grouped in clusters. Their job is to trap foreign bodies such as bacteria or cancer cells to keep them from spreading throughout the body. The nodes are clustered in areas throughout your body such as underams (axilla), groin, neck, chest and abdomen. The ones in your chest and underarm are the ones that collect the lymph fluid from your breast. This is why they are often removed at the time of surgery.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What causes the arm to swell after surgery?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Not every woman's arm swells after surgery. It swells because the number of pathways for the lymph to drain from the arm are reduced by the removal of or damage to the lymph tissue during surgery or radiation therapy. Fewer channels to drain the fluid can result in collection of fluid in the arm (or swelling). The extent of lymph tissue removed or damaged relates to how much swelling you may experience. Swelling may occur weeks, months or even years after treatment.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,Are there any safety precautions I should be aware of?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Yes. Because the lymph channels and nodes have been removed (or decreased) on the side of your surgery, you must take extra caution to protect your hand and arm from injury, cuts, scrapes and insect bites. You may have less protection against infection in that arm. Some people wear a medical alert bracelet with this information on it. It is important to remind healthcare workers to avoid drawing blood and measuring your blood pressure on that arm. It is also recommended that you wear gloves while doing housework, gardening and other activities that may put your arm or hand at risk for injury. In addition, it is possible for lymphedema to occur years after you have finished your treatment; therefore, taking care and being aware are your two best keys to avoiding or managing lymphedema.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What about using antiperspirant or deodorant under my arm?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"You should not use deodorants or antiperspirants while you are healing from surgery on the armpit on the side of your surgery. Once you are healed, you may use either antiperspirants or deodorants. Some doctors may recommend use of deodorants only. You should talk about this with your healthcare team.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What can I do about the swelling? Is it permanent?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"You should talk with your doctor about this. Sometimes, elevation of the arm for brief periods throughout the day is adequate to promote fluid drainage. Other methods to reduce swelling include arm exercises and gentle massage that specifically promote lymph drainage. Your doctor should refer you to a practitioner who specializes in lymphedema treatment if you have a persistent problem with this. More severe cases may require use of pressure sleeves to compress the arm. Lymphedema can be a permanent condition in some cases.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,How do I choose a lymphedema therapist?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Lymphedema therapists have a range of training options. The programs they attend vary in length. When you are choosing a therapist, you might want to consider how much training he or she has.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"The programs include: LeDuc (6 days of training), Lerner (14 days), Casley-Smith(14 days), Academy of Lymphatic Studies (ALS; 14 days), Klose-Norton (15 days), Foldi (20 days), and Vodder (20 days; some programs teach Vodder ""techniques"", but only therapists who",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"have completed the entire program are Vodder credentialed). Recently, the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA) began certifying lymphedema therapists who also passed a comprehensive national exam.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p font span," Will the initial therapy be done daily, and for how many days? (Generally, therapy is given at least five days in a row for early stage, and up to four weeks if the lymphedema is more advanced.)",1,19
html body text table tbody tr td font p font b span  ,What is Manual Lymph Drainage?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Manual Lymph Drainage is a massage technique used to improve the flow of lymph using light, rhythmic strokes. This therapy may be effective for the lymphedema that sometimes follows breast surgery.",1,11

html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,Will chemotherapy cause me to experience menopause?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Before menopause, your ovaries produce estrogen. Estrogen is responsible for your monthly menstrual cycle and reproduction. Some chemotherapy drugs interrupt (temporarily or permanently) ovarian function, which can result in early (or chemotherapy-induced) menopause. This type of menopause can be permanent and has the same effect on your body as naturally-occurring menopause.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What are some of the typical side effects of menopause?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and irregularity or absence of monthly menstrual periods are the most common effects of menopause. Menopause is also associated with bone loss due to reduced calcium stores in the bone.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"After chemotherapy treatment, some women resume their menstrual cycle. If you do not, you should seek advice about calcium replacement and exercise to promote bone health.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,"What can I do to manage side effects of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness?",1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"You should discuss menopause management strategies with your doctor or nurse. For hot flashes, there are medications available; also, many people are beginning to explore the use of alternative therapies, such as soy products or herbs. You should check with your doctor before proceeding with this approach. You must always be cautious about the possibility of drug interactions when taking supplements or herbals in addition to medications.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Other considerations include choosing loose-fitting, comfortable clothing and regulating the temperature control to suit your preference.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Vaginal dryness can be addressed through the use of lubricants prior to sexual activity. There are many products available without prescription to remedy this problem. Persistent vaginal itching should be investigated to rule out the possibility of infection (see also the section below on,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,What is osteoporosis?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Osteoporosis or ""porous bones"" is a condition of decreased bone mass. Bone is living tissue that continuously undergoes breakdown and rebuilding (at a cellular level) as a normal body process. Peak bone mass is usually reached by age 38. After that, bone begins to lose mass as part of the aging process. As bone mass is lost, bones become brittle. Men generally lose 20-30% of their bone mass over their lifetime, and women generally lose 45-50% of their bone mass. Decreased bone mass can lead to an increased risk of bone breakage and disability.",1,11

html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Chemotherapy can interfere with your normal production of hormones due to its effect on ovarian function. Reduction or failure of ovarian function automatically places you at increased risk for osteoporosis. It is important that you discuss prevention and treatment strategies with your doctor or nurse.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,Would I know if I had osteoporosis? Can I be tested for it?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Early changes in bone density are usually painless. Most people don’t know they have osteoporosis until they break a bone. That is why it is important to know the risk factors and to learn what you can do to prevent bone deterioration.,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"Testing can be done for osteoporosis. First, you should have a thorough health history and physical exam to determine your risk factors for osteoporosis. Then, your doctor will discuss or recommend your having a bone mineral density test if you are considered to be at high risk. It is a safe, painless and non-invasive test. This establishes your baseline bone density and provides useful information in determining the best course of action for you.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,"In North Carolina, bone mineral density (BMD) tests are available in some pharmacies. The cost of measuring the BMD in the heel is generally around $30, and this correlates well with the trabicular (spine) bone. This test reveals very little about the cortical (hip) bones, so you will not get the whole picture. However, the test will give you a reasonable assessment and baseline information that you can take to your doctor to see if further testing is needed. The test takes about five minutes or less and is pain free. You can have this test done without a referral from your doctor.",1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font p b font span  ,Can I help prevent osteoporosis from happening to me?,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font p font span  ,Yes. There are a number of prevention strategies that are recommended to reduce your risk for osteoporosis:,1,11

If so, you should be referred to a plastic surgeon for a full discussion of your options.
