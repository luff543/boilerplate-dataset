html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"It was only a few months ago that Beacon Hill lawmakers, worried about financial crises overseas and a spate of local layoffs, were talking about belt-tightening, hoarding cash, and boosting the state's rainy day fund in anticipation of a recession that some seemed certain was just over the horizon.",1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,But money kept pouring in. The political rhetoric about how many months the $1.2 billion emergency reserves could sustain the state began to fade. Agendas blossomed. Spending became the order of the day.,1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,Governor Paul Cellucci produced the largest budget ever filed in Massachusetts history containing plans to lower the income tax rate and heap millions of dollars on pet projects and programs. Weeks later he said he wanted to spend another $300 million from a projected state surplus on one-time road and bridge improvements.,1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"Even before Cellucci got the spending bug, Speaker Thomas M. Finneran unveiled an ambitious and expensive plan to offer public preschool and full-day kindergarten. And Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham cited the surging economy as a reason to sharply increase the minimum wage.",1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"Despite the spending euphoria, economists are still nervous about the not-too-distant future. They say fewer jobs will be created. The financial service sector could be hit by a stock market crash. And consumer confidence may wane.",1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"""One way or another, the economy is going to slow in '99,"" says Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. ""It doesn't have to go down the tubes like it did a decade ago.... A recession is unlikely and Massachusetts wouldn't do any worse than the rest of the country in terms of job loss and how long it stayed down, but the fact that we haven't had a slowdown yet means people should be more cautious, not less cautious.""",1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"While Cellucci's budget message for next year is filled with warnings about ""profligate spending"" and reminders ""of what can happen when government gets caught up in the euphoria that prevails during a robust economy,"" his record $20.4 billion spending plan represents a 5 percent boost over fiscal 1999, giving across-the-board increases to dozens of agencies and programs.",1,14

html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"""Growth is likely to diminish,"" Breimyer said. ""The political establishment here is trying to find a middle line. I think they've done a reasonably good job. There has been a sense of prudence. And I think prudence is warranted.""",1,14
html body text div center table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p big span  ,"However, cities and towns, which have received local aid increases each of the last eight years -- a 113 percent overall jump in spending since 1992 -- are already clamoring for more than the $4.5 billion Cellucci is offering for next year.",1,14
