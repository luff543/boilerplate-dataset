html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Explaining loss of positions to a future employer,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p b span  ,"By Andrea Wolf, Globe Correspondent, 6/20/04",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p i span  ,"At the end of 2000, I was laid off from a job that I loved. The position was rewarding and the company was a great place to work. I was devastated and jumped at the first job opportunity that came my way. I wasn't thrilled with the job but I worked hard and was rewarded with salary increases, bonuses, and company perks during my three years of employment. Last month, I found myself standing in the unemployment line again. Although both layoffs were due to poor business climates and not performance, I feel embarrassed and discouraged. I have stellar references from both employers, including the managers who made the layoff decisions, but I am concerned about what future employers may think. I also wonder if I may be in the wrong profession since I have been dispensable to two employers. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can handle the interview process to put a more positive spin on the situation?",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"You raise the uncomfortable feelings of how to explain your job loss to a future employer. Prepare a ''reason for leaving'' statement.

I had not planned a career change as I enjoyed what I was doing. However, I'm really starting to wonder if it's time to think about doing something else. I just don't feel from what I read about outsourcing that the IT sector will recover. What are your thoughts?",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"With all the changes in the market, everyone needs to be current in their field. In addition, we need to understand outsourcing's impact on business. The nature of work is changing so dramatically that most economists haven't even figured out the implications yet. Although we see the trend of outsourcing IT jobs to some countries and a decrease in these jobs in the United States, it is unclear what the future holds.",1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p i span  ,"I will be leaving my current position in about a year. My annual review is in a few weeks. I recently discovered that someone hired five months ago started at a salary $1,500 a year higher than mine, even though we both have an identical job title and description. I was told by my headhunter when the job was offered to me that there would be no negotiation of salary, so I accepted the offer as it stood. There are multiple problems at work including rampant turnover, low employee morale, and favoritism on the part of the office manager. Do I ignore the salary imbalance and just say ''good riddance'' to the job when it comes time to move on? Do I confront the office manager during my annual review and ask about the disparity in salaries? Do I contact the firm's human resources manager and discuss the disparity with him? Do I contact him now or wait to see what is offered at my review?",1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"If the differences are too great, then you have a choice: leave the company. To stay, complain, and hang in there demonstrates an attitude that will not help you progress in your career.",1,13

At this point, however, I think that raising the salary issue is a waste of your time and may create ill will.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In the future, be wary of a headhunter who says there is no negotiation. They are working for the company to fill the job and not necessarily for your best interests. Understand that negotiation is a natural part of developing a win-win situation with a future employer.",1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,I advise you to view your situation as a learning experience so that moving forward you can proceed at your professional best.,1,13

Positions are often grant-funded in this field, and I have been told that there is often room for flexibility in setting work hours. At what point in the application process should I disclose that I am seeking part-time work?",1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The field of health services research may allow for flexibility in scheduling, but my advice is go for the position as advertised so that you do not eliminate yourself up front.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Your goal is to interview well, get the job offer, and then have a follow-up meeting where you can negotiate for flex time or reduced hours.
