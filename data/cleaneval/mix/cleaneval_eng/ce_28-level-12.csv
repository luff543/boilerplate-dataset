html body text p b span font span  ,Abstract,1,8
html body text p font span span  ,Two troops of captive woolly monkeys wereobserved with the aid of an 8 mm video camera and a proprietary Palm Pilotprogram.,1,7
html body text p font span span  ,"My research up to thepresent will be continued, but with modifications in equipment and methods ofdata.",1,7
html body text p font span span  ,"The two troops differ sinceTroop I consists of a family group with four members; the breeding male Corey,his son Tomas and daughter Sara, and a non-breeding female named Sissi who isthe Corey’s sister.",1,7
html body text p font span span  ,The mother ofTomas and Sara died while giving birth to Sara.,1,7
html body text p font span span  ,"Troop II consists of three unrelated males, with two more unrelated maleswho are currently in isolation to be introduced in the near future.",1,7
html body text p font span span  ,"Troop I is one of only two captive family troops of woolly monkeys in theworld; the other is located in London, England.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The video recordings were analyzedframe-by-frame using a proprietary video digitization program.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The vocalizations were recorded by the video camera as well and analyzedusing Sound Forge to make sound spectrographs, or sonograms.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,A programmed Palm Pilot was used to record the movement and behavior ofboth troops in order to make ethograms to display patterns of behavior andvocalization.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The following was anticipated: 1. vocalizationswould be correlated with visual displays; 2. display function would beidentified through context; 3 individuals would be identified through harmonicsin the sonograms; 4. the behavior and vocalizations of the two troops woulddiffer; and 5. the behavioral analysis would be useful for maintaining andbreeding captive troops.,1,7
html body text p b span font span  ,Introduction,1,8
html body text p span font span  ,The common woolly monkey (,1,7
html body text p span font i span  ,Lagothrixlagothricha,1,8
html body text p span font span  ,"), also known as Humboldt's woolly monkey, is found only in SouthAmerica in the Amazon River Basin of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, andVenezuela.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"They range in all canopy levels of primary rainforest as wellas gallery forests, and have been found in mountainous areas and cloud forestsup to 3,000 meters.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Theclassification of the common woolly monkey is as follows:,1,7

html body text table tbody tr td p i span font o:p, ,0,12
html body text p span font span  ,The morphology of the common woolly monkey is similar to that of othermonkeys in the Atelinae subfamily.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Thewoolly monkey is the largest monkey in South America, with the female weightaveraging 11 pounds and the male weight averaging 15 pounds.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,They have a prehensile tail that can support their fullweight and is used for feeding and locomotion.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Woolly monkeys can have dark brown, pale brown, dark gray, pale gray,reddish-brown, or black fur.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Thelimbs, tail, and head are usually darker than the back, with the face beingblack and the palms of the hands and feet being pink.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Slight sexual dimorphism exists including the canines, body, and head inthe males being longer than females.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"However,the female's tail is longer than the male's and the female's clitoris is longerthan the males' penis, which sometimes makes it difficult to determine the sexin the wild.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Humboldt's woolly monkey is primarily frugivorous, but they also feed onleaves, seeds, flowers, and some invertebrates and small mammals.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,In captivity they have been known to prey upon birds that flyinto their cages.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The group sizefor woolly monkeys averages 10-12 group members, but much larger groups areknown to exist.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Subgroups sometimesform and travel independently from the larger group.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Woolly monkeys are not territorial and allow group ranges to overlap andhave been known to forage alongside each other as well as other species in theirfamily.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The woolly monkey travelsthrough the forest quadrupedally using its tail as a fifth arm.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"They rarely come down to the ground and, therefore, are known to bealmost totally arboreal.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,They even sleep 150 feet above the ground in the canopy.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"When on the ground, which is especially rare in the wild, they walkbipedally, using their arms and tail to balance.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The tail is extremely important and is always anchored to something; itis used to pick up objects and sometimes even allows the monkeys to rest byhanging from just the tail.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The social structure of the common woollymonkey is a multi-male-multi-female group in which a hierarchy exists betweenthe males in the group.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Thedominance hierarchy is determined by play-fighting and age.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The species' mating system is polygamous because each receptive femalemates with every male in the group, with the most dominant males receiving themost copulations.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Because of this,the male that succeeds in passing on his genes is the one that releases more andbetter-fit sperm per session, with multiple sessions increasing the likelihood.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Therefore, every male mates with every female, but only one female iscopulated with at any given time.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Inaddition to receiving the most copulations, the most dominant males also receivethe most social grooming and are known to protect mothers and their infants fromothers in the group.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"In general,adult and subadult males are dominant over all other members in the group.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Male woolly monkeys are philopatric, which means that the males stay inthe group in which they were born, known as their natal group, while the femalesleave their natal group.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Femaledispersion usually occurs between the ages of five and a half years to sixyears, the same ages that females begin to mate.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Although females begin to mate between those ages, they remain sterileand do not conceive until one to three years after they leave their natalgroups.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The gestation periodaverages seven and a half months, or about 223 days, and the female gives birthto one young about every two to three years during the birthing season, whichoccurs between the months of August and December.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"After birth, the infants nurse from sixteen to twenty months, travelingindependently by six months.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Little research on woolly monkeys exists, with the majority of theresearch focused on ecology, morphology, location, social structure, and so on.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Research on the behavior and vocalizations of the common woolly monkey isalmost completely nonexistent.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Theresearch on woolly monkey behavior and vocalization that has been done wasperformed by M. Ramirez and published through the World Wildlife Fund in 1988.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"His research was made into a ""dictionary"" that explained thebehavior or reason behind each vocalization, which he spelled out using humanphonetics.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,He also explained someof the woolly monkeys' visual communication.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Although thorough in some respects, his research did not investigatesequences of behavior and vocalization or analyze each individual separatelywith respect to behavior and vocalization sequences.",1,7
html body text p b span font span  ,Methods,1,8
html body text p span font span  ,"My research on the common woolly monkey wasconducted at the Louisville Zoo, one of only two places in the world that have acaptive family troop.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"After beingformally introduced to the monkeys by the head veterinarian, I was able to begincollecting data.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Before startingthe data collection process, I decided to spend a few weeks observing the twotroops in order to become acquainted with the individuals.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"During the three weeks of strict observation, I took notice of eachbehavior and began compiling a list of the observed behaviors.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,This list is located in the results and discussion section.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"I also realized that not only could I tell the monkeys apart visually,but vocally as well.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"After becoming familiar with the behaviors (displays) andvocalizations of the monkeys, I began collecting data.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The data collection consisted of a variety ofmethods including the use of an 8 mm video camera to record behaviors, a minidisk recorder to record the vocalizations, and a proprietary Palm Pilot programto record the movement and behavior of each individual in the two troops as wellas the overall behavior of each troop.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Atfirst, I videotaped the woolly monkeys individually.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,This method was not effective because the behavior of the other woollymonkeys could not be seen and the monkeys move extremely fast and it isdifficult to follow them around the cage.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Ithen tried to videotape sections of the cage, but that did not work well eitherbecause I could not differentiate between the monkeys because of the camera’sbad resolution.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"After four hours ofrecording over one month, I realized that I needed a much better video camera inorder to continue with the research.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Formy future research I will have a video camera with superior resolution.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The video recordings that I had were used to learn and practice thedigitization process.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Therecordings were digitized and transferred to compact disk for later analysis.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The digitized version of the video recordings could beanalyzed at 1/10 of a second, with the potential advantages including theability to record the behavior at set intervals, allowing the viewer to recordthe behavior of all the monkeys in view.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The mini disk recorder was used in conjunctionwith the video camera.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Iexperienced multiple difficulties and problems with the mini disk recorder thateventually led me to discontinue using it in this project.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,This will be discussed further in the results and discussion section.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Because I did not have any vocalizations recorded, I decided to use thesound from the video recordings for my vocalization analysis.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Sound Forge, a computer program used for the sound analysis, enabled meto make sound spectrographs, or sonograms, on the woolly monkey vocalizations.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"In order to analyze just the woolly monkey vocalizations and not all ofthe background noise, adjustment was required. With Sound Forge, I was able todelete all of the outside and background noise that included crickets, birds,trains, human voices, and so on.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The proprietary Palm Pilot program used for recording the behaviors wascalled Pen Recorder and the program used to analyze the recordings was calledPen Reviewer.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Below are diagrams ofPen Recorder, Pen Reviewer, and View Data.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Whenusing Pen Recorder, I had to designate letters of the alphabet to the observedbehaviors.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Once I started PenRecorder, I wrote the letter of every behavior that I observed an individualdoing until they went inside or went to sleep.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,This method was difficult because it was impossible to keep up with thebehaviors while having to remember which letter went with which behavior as wellas write the letter and then keep going.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Thecollected data was viewed in Pen Reviewer under View Data, displayed above, andthen analyzed in the form of a graph, time line, and matrix, displayed below.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Afterusing this technique for a while, I decided to change my method of recordingbecause of the above stated reason as well as the fact that certain monkeys weremore active than the others and I had to start and stop recording for thedifferent individuals, which does not heed good results for analysis.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"For my further research, I will be using a new method of recordingbehaviors.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Instead of using theproprietary Palm Pilot program, I will be using a tablet PC with a voicerecognition program so I can just speak each behavior as it occurs.",1,7

html body text p span font b span  ,Tomas,1,8
html body text p span font span  ,Corey is the dominant breeding male and is father to both Sara and Tomas.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Sissi is Corey's sister and is the dominant non-breeding female.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Sissi has never had any offspring and is considered sterile.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The position of the second most dominant member of the troop is currentlybeing fought over between Sissi and Tomas.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Because Tomas is a subadult male and Sissi is an adultfemale, he and Sissi fight over everything, from food to where to sleep.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Thomas and Sara are siblings and fight and play in ways similar to humansiblings, but still show affection quite often, grooming each other and restingnext to each other.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Tomas and his father Corey appear to have the closest relationship withinthe group.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Tomas follows Coreyaround, mimicking certain behaviors.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"WhenTomas and Sara are resting together or grooming each other, Corey generallyjoins them.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Strange to humanviewers, the family troop members are sexual with each other, especially Coreyand Tomas and Corey and Sara.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Sexualitybetween family members is surprisingly common in the primate world.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"According to primate research, it is quite normal for a father and son tofeel on each other's genitals and have erections when around one another.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"These behaviors are considered greetings and are meant to establishfriendly contact, usually occurring between adult males and juveniles of bothsexes.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"During my observations, Inoticed that Corey and Sissi rarely interact, while the same is true for Saraand Sissi.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"The monkeys in the family troop have differing personalities, with Coreyas the alpha male.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"He is thelargest monkey, with huge canines and constant eye movement that indicates aneurological disorder, though not apparent in any other way.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Corey never plays and is always pacing the cage, eating,grooming himself or others, staring at outside disturbances, or resting.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Only after about a month of observation Corey appeared not to consider mean outside threat anymore, showing behaviors indicating a friendly greeting andthen calming down other group members through appeasement behaviors.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,This meant that I could now observe their behavior undisturbed byoutsiders.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Tomas is more of a lonerfor the majority of the time; shy toward outsiders, he never makes eye contactwith me, which is unlike all the others in the group.",1,7

html body text p span font span  ,"Sheis, however, active toward me, cage shaking, which is a sign that she feelsthreatened, and intense staring sessions at me, most likely indicating that shedoes not approve of my presence.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Whennot interacting with Tomas or me, Sissi rests high up in the top of the cage,far away from everything and everyone else.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Sara on the other hand is the most active and social member of the group.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Sara is always doing something, whether watching me, playing with Tomas,resting with Corey and/or Tomas, eating, playing by herself with toys, or justrunning around bipedally on the cage floor.",1,7

html body text p span font span  ,"Inaddition to using the video recording of the woolly monkeys for behavioralanalysis, it was also used for sound analysis.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"I used a computer program called Sound Forge, which enabled me to makesound spectrographs, or sonograms, of the woolly monkey vocalizations. In orderto analyze just the woolly monkey vocalizations and not all of the backgroundnoise, adjustment was required.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"UsingSound Forge enabled me to delete all of the outside and background noiseincluding crickets, birds, trains, human voices, and so on.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,I was able to produce several sonograms from the data collected bylistening to the sounds while watching the screen and marking where I heardcommon sounds of the woolly monkey.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Thesecommon sounds included shrieks, squeaks, and grunts.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Ithen performed a spectrum analysis, an option in Sound Forge, in order to viewthe vocalizations in the form of a sound spectrograph.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Although this analysis is not yet complete, it will be continued in thefuture.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"After more spectrographsare made and analyzed, I will be able to differentiate between individuals justby looking at their sonograms because it is my hypothesis that each individualproduces different sound spectrographs although they make the samevocalizations.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The human ear mightnot be able to differentiate between individuals when they are making the samesounds as others so this data will be useful in further vocalization research inwoolly monkey populations.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Thesound spectrograph below is of a squeak.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The next sound spectrograph is ofa screech.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The last sound spectrograph is of a grunt.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Formy further research, I will be using a new method to record behaviors.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"Instead of using the proprietary Palm Pilot program, I willbe using a tablet PC with a voice recognition program so I can just speak eachbehavior as it occurs.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The programis called Dragon records what I say and analyzes the data in a similar manner tothat of the proprietary Palm Pilot program.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"I will also be using an Elura 40 digital video camcorder, which hassuperior resolution and sound quality combined with the ability to take digitalphotographs.",1,7
html body text p span font span  ,The camera also has asteadier that eliminates most of the shakiness from holding the camera.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,Theobservation of Troop II will begin when the two new unrelated male monkeys areintroduced to Monkey Island.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,I willcontinue recording more vocalizations and perform more in depth analysis usingSound Forge.,1,7
html body text p span font span  ,"This research will behelpful in teaching zoo personnel and others interested in woolly monkeys abouttheir behaviors and vocalizations, as well as being useful for maintaining andbreeding captive troops.",1,7
