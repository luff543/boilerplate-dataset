html body text div p strong span  ,Summary:,1,7
html body text div p em span  ,How your church can have a volunteer team of cyber-missionaries that can minister cross-culturally to unreached peoples at a total cost of between $1000 to $5000 a year and see between 100 and 1100 decisions for Christ in that people group.,1,7

html body text div p font span  ,Worldwide Internet Population:,1,7
html body text div p span span  ,445.9 million (eMarketer),1,7
html body text div p span span  ,533 million (Computer Industry Almanac),1,7
html body text div p font span  ,Projection for 2004:,1,7
html body text div p span span  ,709.1 million (eMarketer),1,7
html body text div p span span  ,945 million (Computer Industry Almanac),1,7
html body text div p font span  ,Online Language Populations (September 2002),1,7
html body text div p span span  ,"English 36.5%; Chinese 10.9%, Japanese 9.7%, Spanish 7.2%, German 6.7%, Korean 4.5%,",0,7
html body text div p span span  ,"Italian 3.8%, French 3.5%, Portuguese 3.0%, Russian 2.9%, Dutch 2.0% (Source: Global Reach)",0,7
html body text div p span span  ,"From the above statistics it is clear that the Internet is no longer predominantly an English speaking medium and that Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean now occupy a significant portion of cyber-space along with major European languages such as Spanish., Portuguese and French.",1,7
html body text div p span span  ,"There are over 275 million Internet searches each day and 80% of all Internet sessions begin at a search engine (Internetstatistics.com). Religion is one of the main topics people search for. Pew Internet surveys found that 28 million Americans get religion information online, that three million do so daily, and that 25 % of net users search for religion-related topics. Barna Research estimates that up to 50 million Americans may worship solely over the Internet by 2010. There is every indication that the Internet is a major source of religious information where people of many cultures and languages collect their spiritual facts and opinions in private. Thus it�s a place where missionaries must be.",1,7
html body text div h3 span  ,What Is The Role Of A Local Church?,1,6
html body text div p span span  ,"Local churches can create a Cybermissions Project Team (CPT) that uses the church website, chat rooms and email to reach a specific ethnic group for Christ. A well-run cybermissions website can see three people a day or about 1100 people a year make commitments to Jesus as Lord and Savior.",1,7
html body text div p span span  ,"This is because the website is a �perpetual evangelist� that works away 24/7 witnessing to seekers about Christ. The Internet is seeker-driven. People using the Internet are seeking information via search engines and links on other sites. When people arrive at your website its not an accident. They have typed a query into a search engine and arrived there. People not interested in God simply don�t arrive at your church website � they end up somewhere else, reading the weather or the news. So virtually 100% of the people you minister to will already have some level of interest. This makes evangelism so much easier! You can witness, via the Internet 24/7 to people who are already interested in finding out about God!",1,7

html body text div font span  ,1.,0,6
html body text div font span strong span  ,Form a small group,1,8
html body text div font span span  ,"of say 6 to 8 people which should include a few �techie� computer types, a few �bible� types and someone with enthusiasm for missions.",1,7
html body text div font span span  ,"The pastor does not need to lead the group, he/she can just give it some guidelines and get a monthly report. The group should be led by someone with a passion for missions on the Internet. The group can fit into the church structure in a similar way to creative ministry teams.",1,7
