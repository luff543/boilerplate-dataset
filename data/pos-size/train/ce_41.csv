html body text div p span span  ,"There are over 275 million Internet searches each day and 80% of all Internet sessions begin at a search engine (Internetstatistics.com).

Barna Research estimates that up to 50 million Americans may worship solely over the Internet by 2010.

html body text div h3 span  ,What Is The Role Of A Local Church?,146,942,307,21,1,6
html body text div p span span  ,"Local churches can create a Cybermissions Project Team (CPT) that uses the church website, chat rooms and email to reach a specific ethnic group for Christ. A well-run cybermissions website can see three people a day or about 1100 people a year make commitments to Jesus as Lord and Savior.",8,983,761,53,1,7
html body text div p span span  ,"This is because the website is a �perpetual evangelist� that works away 24/7 witnessing to seekers about Christ. The Internet is seeker-driven. People using the Internet are seeking information via search engines and links on other sites. When people arrive at your website its not an accident. They have typed a query into a search engine and arrived there. People not interested in God simply don�t arrive at your church website � they end up somewhere else, reading the weather or the news. So virtually 100% of the people you minister to will already have some level of interest. This makes evangelism so much easier! You can witness, via the Internet 24/7 to people who are already interested in finding out about God!",8,1054,762,127,1,7
