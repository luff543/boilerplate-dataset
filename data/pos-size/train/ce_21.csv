html body text div div div span  ,"The course, being flat and very short (6 km), favors a strong, powerful rider such as Ullrich. But maybe an unknown will surprise being that most of the favs will be hoping to peak in about three weeks instead of now. :)",8,4568,746,35,1,7

They showed coverage of a press conference with Lance from yesterday where he was fielding questions about the book allegations. One of the writers, David Walsh, was in attendance, and Lance was staring him down hardcore during the questioning. It was pretty sweet. :)",8,4658,745,53,1,7

html body text div div div span  ,"I'm not sure Lance would want the yellow jersey this early in the tour. He has said in the past it is hard to defend the yellow jersey, and defending it from the very start of the race is hard on the team.",8,4766,742,35,1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"If I remember correctly, Lance finished 7th in last year's Prologue, so I wouldn't be too shocked if he wasn't in yellow after tomorrow.",8,4820,753,35,1,7
html body text div div div span  ,"After watching ""The Lance Chronicles"" yesterday, and the OLN tour preview, it seems a lot of folks are thinking Lance is going to win this thing. I must confess, I don't think he's going to, but during the episode of ""The Lance Chronicles"" that I saw (when he was talking about the Dauphine Libre), he seemed confident even though Mayo beat him by 2 minutes in the time trial. He said ""Two minutes is a lot"" but he had this goofy grin on his face as if to say ""I know something you don't know."" Could he have been sandbagging in the Dauphine?",8,4874,764,89,1,7

html body text div div div span  ,"I don't know a lot about the sport, but I'll make a bold (all be it wild) guess at the Prologue result. I'll guess Tyler Hamilton. He's a good time trialer, and he's hungry. I think a yellow jersey would mean the world to him. Perhaps tomorrow will be his day.",8,5036,727,53,1,7
