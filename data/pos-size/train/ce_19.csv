The only noteworthy event from the train ride was actually after it was over and everyone was collecting their baggage. Apparantly a lady had died during the ride, which was brought to my attention as the corpse was carried past me and tossed into the back of a van, as if she were unclaimed luggage. Sadly, the only people that seemed to think it was unusual were me and the other backpackers that had taken the overnight train. All of the locals seemed unphased by it. From Oruro, I only had a 3 hour bus ride to get to La Paz, which had been overbooked, but luckily I was already in my seat when someone came to claim it as theirs, showing a ticket that was identical to mine.

html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,"The Salar de Uyuni in southwestern Bolivia covers 12,000 square km, and is the worlds largest salt flats. About 30,000 years ago, the salt flats were covered by a lake called Lago Munchin. When the sea dried up, it left the Salar de Uyuni, which contains about 10 billion tons of salt. At its deepest point, the salt is about 8 meters deep. I wanted to visit the salt flats when I was in Bolivia in October, but didn't have time. So when my flight from Buenos Aires to Lima was cancelled, I decided it was a sign that I should make my own way to Bolivia and see them. I arrived in Uyuni after a 2 hour flight and about 14 hours of bus rides and organized a three day, two night tour of the Salt flats and some nearby lakes.",162,1031,458,197,1,11
