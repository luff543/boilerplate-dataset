html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p i span  ,"At the end of 2000, I was laid off from a job that I loved. The position was rewarding and the company was a great place to work. I was devastated and jumped at the first job opportunity that came my way. I wasn't thrilled with the job but I worked hard and was rewarded with salary increases, bonuses, and company perks during my three years of employment. Last month, I found myself standing in the unemployment line again. Although both layoffs were due to poor business climates and not performance, I feel embarrassed and discouraged. I have stellar references from both employers, including the managers who made the layoff decisions, but I am concerned about what future employers may think. I also wonder if I may be in the wrong profession since I have been dispensable to two employers. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can handle the interview process to put a more positive spin on the situation?",129,164,492,233,1,14
