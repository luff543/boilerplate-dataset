html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The increasing complexity of today's healthcare equipment procurement environment has presented some new challenges for medical device manufacturing companies and their sales representatives. To gain a competitive edge in influencing product selection may require struggle. The emergence of intricate purchasing plans, contract-buying trends, and shifting pricing options constitute one set of challenges. Another relates to the growing complexity of medical technology itself, particularly its incorporation of information technology (IT) capabilities.",194,1221,475,143,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Medical device manufacturers and their field reps are discovering several healthcare industry procurement hurdles that need to be overcome. Group purchasing organizations (GPOs), contractual buying arrangements, on-line ordering, and face-to-face selling are each scenarios that present a distinct challenge for pricing and relationship building. A tool that can be of value in each of these situations is mobile sales force automation (SFA) technology.",194,1381,484,125,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Face-to-face selling is made easier by the development of personal relationships with physicians and surgeons in situations where they play an important role in purchasing. When doctors demand considerable technical data, product training, and manufacturer support, those sales reps armed with real-time data and interactive presentation tools will be the ones most likely to close a sale.",194,1523,552,89,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In an effort to foster better relationships with, and provide more value to, physicians—and to the healthcare industry generally—some medtech companies are investing in integrated sales, marketing, and supply-chain management systems that are known as customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Mobile SFA is a primary tool driving this initiative to meet, on demand and in the field, ever-growing customer needs (see sidebar).",194,1629,422,125,1,21

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In the hospital environment, purchasing departments and GPOs tend to control vendor selection, product pricing, and the awarding of contracts. This holds true especially with commodity-based products such as disposables (surgical gloves, swabs, and so on) where price is the primary differentiator and organizations are reordering more often than making first-time purchases. Rather than buying directly from a sales rep, these purchasing groups use electronic purchasing technology such as electronic data interchange (EDI) to maximize ordering efficiency and optimize savings.",194,2073,552,125,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Since the decisionmaking process and the sales cycle for disposable products are both very short, new purchasing and inventory replenishment tend to be conducted on-line. Here, manufacturers need to distinguish their products from competitors' while offering the lowest price and an efficient ordering process. Despite stringent pricing constraints prevalent in this category, sales reps with real-time mobile access to pricing models, product specifications, inventory information, and delivery schedules during the sales call gain advantage for their employers in terms of better CRM functionality, more-efficient document management, and electronic order submission and tracking. Mobile technology gives reps the ability to capture, store, and view account history during the sales call, and to present new products immediately at launch.",194,2215,557,179,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"At the other end of the medical device spectrum are capital goods—heavy, expensive, highly sophisticated medical equipment.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Owing to the complexity of these products, the surgeon or physician who uses them typically makes or strongly influences the purchasing decision.
