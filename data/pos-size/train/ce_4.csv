Inone way, I was rather fortunate and blessed by the Gods that, first I didnot die on the spot, or during the first three following days, which isoften the case, and second that the accident took place in the right sideof my brain, thus affecting the left side of my body; should had it beenthe reverse, I should have lost speech and my hand-writing capability,a full disaster for me who happen to be a right-handed person. After sixmonths of highly dedicated rehabilitation in a physiotherapy clinic, witha lot of will, endurance and determination I could recover pretty wellbut not enough to be able to take up my old job again. I was dismissedby my company in 1995 and was declared an invalid by the French SocialSecurity. Since then I am so to say a kind of person in early retirement.",8,763,761,215,1,7

html body text p b font span  ,"Born in France, (in a familynative of Alsace near the German border, why my name does not sound typicallyFrench, like Dupont or Durand), just after Worl War II, in late November1945, I had always been a very religious boy, but when I reached 14, Icould no longer remain satisfied with the creeds, beliefs and practicesof the Roman Catholic Church, in which I had been being born and educated.These did not appear to me � catholic � enough, as this wordshould originally mean � universal �. One day, about November1960 (i.e. aged more or less exactly 15), while looking at random at booksin a bookshop that I used to visit quite often (in Paris where I was bornand living at that time), I started to turn over, just by a stroke of luck,the pages of the French translation of � J��na Yoga� of Sv�m� Vivek�nanda, and was seized with wonderseeing that the book included two chapters on a universal religion. I feltthis was exactly what I was longing for, and I bought the book immediatelyand read it eagerly from cover to cover: I was overwhelmed with joy andwanted to know more. After reading � J��na Yoga � several times, I wanted to know also about S'r� R�makrishna.I started to look for further literature on the Paramahamsa, and in a rathersmall booklet learnt at last that there existed one R�makrishna Ved�ntaCentre in France. I got the address from the Indian Embassy in Paris. Allthese investigations had of course taken some time, and it was only inearly May 1961 (it was thus exactly 40 years on the 4th of May 2001), aged15 year and a half, that I first visited the French R�makrishna Ved�ntaCentre in Gretz.There, I came fortunately very rapidly into a tight andfriendly relationship with a brahm�c�ri, disciple of the lateSv�m� Siddhes'var�nanda, who had founded the Centre in1937 in Paris, and had then established it in Gretz in 1947. Unfortunatelyhe had passed away 4 years earlier, in beginning April 1957 and I couldnot meet him personally. Sv�m� Siddhes'var�nanda washimself a disciple of Sv�m� Brahm�nanda, a direct discipleof S'r� R�makrishna, appearing often in the so-called �Gospel � (I do not like the use of this Christian name and preferto stick to the original tittle � Kath�mrita �: Sv�m�Brahm�nanda was R�kh�l, in the inner circle of youngdisciples, and later he became the President of the Math and Mission).I became fortunately very rapidly an enthusiastic student of the above-mentionedbrahm�c�ri.",8,1171,769,443,1,7

html body text p b font span  ,"Married in 1974, my wifeand I have two sons now aged 25 and 23 who are studying and preparing themselvesfor the highest posts in the University. The eldest one is studying Historyand the youngest one Philosophy. When they have finished their studies,if my health is still permitting, and with the blessings of the DIVINEMOTHER, we intend to write all three of us a book on ""some aspects of Ved�ntain the XXth-century"". In the meantime as they have of course quite a lotof other subjects to prioritise, I have started writing some articles basedon the archives I have available here. And this is where the IITM softwareis proving extremely useful to me. Although I try not to overdo it withthem, those articles (or a few other translations I am continuing to doon the subject and some of which might have their place in the main dissertation)often include quotations or footnotes with Sanskrit words or s�loka-s.It is obvious that most Westerners cannot the Sanskrit language, but Iprefer in any case to supply the Sanskrit text for some translated s�loka-sso that the readers can at least recognise the words. This being the case,it is of utmost importance to cite the aforesaid quotations in diacriticisedRoman transliteration. But I have decided as a personal discipline as awell as an introduction to the Sanskrit language for my sons to show thetext also in devan�gar�. And in this respect the IITM softwareis really unparalleled. Of course in the beginning things were not veryeasy for me, all the more as -as far as computers are concerned- I am onlyan average user and not at all a specialist of the information technology.But Dr R. Kalyanakrishnan spared no effort to help me and to facilitatethings for me (even at the expense of explaining very basic details thatI should have known, or reminding me some other ones I had known (whenstarting the computerisation of my firm) but had later forgotten), andI really feel very indebted and grateful to him for all what he has donein this respect.",8,3639,769,345,1,7

html body text p b font span  ,"Thus the parts of the IITMsoftware that are of special and main interest to me are the ones thatrefer to Sanskrit and I.P.A. transliteration.

As a fact I have some Hindu friends in what was until recentlyWest Bengal, in Kerala and also in Karnataka, and when writing to themby now I always try to write their first names in their own languages,Bangla, Kannada or Malay�lam. This is only a small sign of friendship:they know I cannot their language and do not intend to learn it either.But I shall never speak Sanskrit with anybody either at least in this life!My purpose is not to be able to buy milk in Sanskrit (as the CD-ROMs releasedlast year by Samskrita Bh�rati would like me to be able to do). Myvery limited and egoistic aim is nothing but to try to read, understandcorrectly and if possible translate accurately into French just a few jewelsof the Scriptures, of S'r� S'a.nkara's bh�shya-s and of theK�rik�-s.
