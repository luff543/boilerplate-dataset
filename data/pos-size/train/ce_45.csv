html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Consider the ""traditional"" approach commonly used to deal with performance issues. We are all familiar with the tried-and-true ""printf"" approach for measuring method call times. This technique can be quite useful, except when you have to correlate individual method times with an end-user experience. Spreadsheets and calculators can be your friend here, but it can be very time consuming.",180,1855,557,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"You might also be able to leverage a variety of operating system tools to help diagnose the problem. If the production machine is hitting 100% CPU utilization, you might leverage a tool such as glance to analyze the problem. Or, if you're experiencing thread contention or Java memory issues, you might leverage specific JVM tools to identify the bottleneck. Often, these techniques are too bottoms-up, making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand how any single component might impact the end user's experience.",180,1961,557,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If you're lucky, you may have had the opportunity to work with some simple management tools.

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Bottom line, many of the current approaches used to diagnose performance problems are often very time-intensive, requiring hours or days to diagnose.

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"In this particular scenario, an IT operator or the application owner is monitoring the application for availability and response time. They might be using a product such as HP OpenView Internet Service (OVIS) to monitor the application from end-to-end to determine overall availability and performance. Here, we see a screenshot of this product indicating that the response time of our application is not in an acceptable state. As the operator or support specialist does some quick root cause analysis, he finds that it is your application that isn't performing up to defined service levels. He contacts you immediately and asks you to look at a problem that is occurring with your application. He doesn't tell you much except that your application transaction response time rate is twice the accepted rate. So how are you going to solve this problem?
