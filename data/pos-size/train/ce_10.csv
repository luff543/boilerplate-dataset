html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to be the official religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the topic of another discussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For the next 1500 years, all other religions or philosophies were ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire, to the point of knowledge of many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients, realizing that practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to the torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid their knowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were practically the only ones with any sort of education, and thus were trusted to read, write, and interpret for Rome. Fast forward to somewhere in the 1600's when King James decided that the bible should be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars including Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew & Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds that sprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV in such a way that the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All one has to do is decipher it.",211,1368,561,251,1,17
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Now, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it is arranged the way it is. If someone was to write a code without leaving any sort of decoding manual, it stands to reason that the means of decoding his work would have to be included in his work. The first step to deciphering this code would be to look for extremes. Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center of the bible (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible. As such, it almost jumps out and screams ""Hey, look at me!"" Psalms 117 has exactly 33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life of Christ, and 33 generations from Adam to David.",211,1636,563,143,1,17

Here is a little tidbit suggestive of this theory. Count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible. You will find that it is Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter and find that the 46th word is ""Shake"". Count 46 words backwards from the end of that chapter and find that the 46th word is ""spear"". The mathematical laws of probability eliminate the ""coincidence"" theory, and we conclude that with this method of ""counting the bible"" rather than reading the bible we are on the right track.",211,1796,558,125,1,17

Many are familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the whole pantheon of gods and goddesses.

Odin had 12 chief priests, Solomon had 12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples. The 1 + 12 phenomenon is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there is a Judge, and twelve jurors.

At one point it was discovered that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was long known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people realized that the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound arrangements had a soothing effect, while some had an angering effect, or a saddening effect. Ancient temples were often constructed in such a way that the songs sung during services would have a maximum effect on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render humans unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to conceal. Unscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the detriment of society. When languages were constructed, their vowels and consonants were assigned numerical values.
