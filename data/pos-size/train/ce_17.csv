Their job is to trap foreign bodies such as bacteria or cancer cells to keep them from spreading throughout the body.

It swells because the number of pathways for the lymph to drain from the arm are reduced by the removal of or damage to the lymph tissue during surgery or radiation therapy. Fewer channels to drain the fluid can result in collection of fluid in the arm (or swelling). The extent of lymph tissue removed or damaged relates to how much swelling you may experience.

Because the lymph channels and nodes have been removed (or decreased) on the side of your surgery, you must take extra caution to protect your hand and arm from injury, cuts, scrapes and insect bites. You may have less protection against infection in that arm. Some people wear a medical alert bracelet with this information on it. It is important to remind healthcare workers to avoid drawing blood and measuring your blood pressure on that arm. It is also recommended that you wear gloves while doing housework, gardening and other activities that may put your arm or hand at risk for injury.

Bone is living tissue that continuously undergoes breakdown and rebuilding (at a cellular level) as a normal body process. Peak bone mass is usually reached by age 38.

Men generally lose 20-30% of their bone mass over their lifetime, and women generally lose 45-50% of their bone mass.
