Men have, at times, wisely directed such organizations, especially when the Club has met for some class work and the man in charge has been qualified to teach in that definite work. But a woman seems especially fitted for Club leadership because of her understanding of the problems which the girl constantly meets. The Camp Fire Girls’ Manual outlines the qualifications of a “Guardian” (as the Camp Fire Leaders are called) in the following way: “Camp Fire Guardians are older women, who, because of their larger experiences, are able to lead the girls into larger interests.

And they have been successful under older women who have had the spirit of youth in their hearts. The kind of Leader desired depends upon the situation at hand. The social worker hunts for a volunteer worker. The employer searches for someone to employ. In either case, the task is essentially the same. The social worker must find someone who is willing to take up the task and who will be faithful to her responsibilities.

The Settlement or Guild director can then often suggest certain activities when she knows that the Leader is qualified to carry them on. The Club Leader herself does not always realize that her talents can be of practical use, until the questioning of the organizer brings the matter to her attention and points out the possibilities. This search for some talents often reveals others which are equally useful, and the Club Leader comes to realize this important fact—that Girls’ Club work is wide in its possibilities and its requirements, and that—whatever she herself can do well—this very training can be passed on to her girls.",85,2824,615,197,1,12

To have the Club do its most effective work, the leader must be wholeheartedly interested in its members and their development. Real interest in the girls means interest not merely in their meetings of one or two hours a week or a month. The influence of the best Club Leader extends far beyond these comparatively short periods of their being together in the Club, out into the lives, of the girls, whether at home, at work, or in school. She gets intimately acquainted with them and knows their family life, their problems, and their interests. No matter who or where the girl is, of what age or nationality, she will respond to real interest and will instinctively go for advice to her who she, feels is her real friend.",85,4207,615,233,1,12

She had called in the homes of the girls and had come to know their families. She remembered their birthdays with cards and went to see them when they were sick. She gave parties for them to which they were sometimes invited to bring young men. She could not direct plays or get up a Glee Club, and yet when her girls wished to do those things, they had little difficulty in finding someone who was willing to help them in that special line. Such instances as this encourage tentative Club Leaders who perhaps feel that they have not sufficient ability for Club work.

And, on the contrary, how often has she blessed the Club Leader who is always present at meetings, always on time, and who has always made the plans for which she said she would be responsible! The best Club Leader places faithfulness to her word before her own personal pleasure, and her influence upon the girls is strong or weak according as she considers her Club important or unimportant. One Club Leader once wrote a pledge which, in her opinion, was the most important for a worker among girls to observe. The pledge was as follows: “I will always keep my promises to my girls, unless some real reason prevents. By real reason, I do not mean an attractive social engagement.”",85,4927,612,161,1,12

Any who have dealt with girls know what a “crush,” or passionate hero-worship, is; and have come to dread its appearance as destructive to team work and Club cooperation. Incipient hero-worship is but natural in girls. They are at the hero-worshiping age. The wise Club Leader will not shun nor treat with disdain the young ‘girl who dogs her footsteps. Rather, she will make of it the opportunity for developing a real and vital friendship. And by showing an attitude of simple cordiality and dispassionate interest, she will almost invariably be able to win a steady loyalty quite different from flaming and fluctuating adoration, and far more lasting. A director of many Girls’ Clubs once pointed with pride to the fact that this spirit of passion was lacking in all of her organization. “Some people will tell you that it is impossible to carry on Girls’ Club work without it,” she remarked, “but it is possible and we know it because we have done it.

At the outset, she had had in mind the conducting of a class like the Physical Training classes she had conducted in her gymnasium. She soon found that she could not do it in that way. At first she was inclined to reprimand the girls for getting out of line and for giggling, but when she stopped to consider the fact that lunch time was their only free hour during the day, she soon lost all desire to see them standing in rows,’ learning steps the entire time. So there was no reprimand for the girls who laughed heartily at their own efforts to do the dances. She provided songs and games for part of the half-hour with the result that when the time came for the dance work, the girls invariably gave earnest attention to it. The result of this policy on her part was the creation of an atmosphere of sociability and enjoyment rather than of work to be done. [",85,5729,615,233,1,12

In order to accomplish this, she must know each girl. Her help can then be given wisely. But such acquaintance cannot be gained, at once, nor without definitely searching for it. For “knowing each girl” means far more than being able to recognize her upon the street and calling her by name. It includes acquaintance with her family and her home life, her education, her surroundings, her interests—in short, an acquaintance with the forces which have made her what she is. If, a Leader has definitely in mind what she wishes to, know about her girls, any conversation will give her an opportunity to learn the desired facts. It may be some time before the Leader knows all that she wishes concerning her girls. Many Club Leaders have found it far wiser to approach the girls gradually than to go to them in the attitude of a cross-questioner and by constant questioning to arouse their suspicions and antagonism.
