We checked the surrounding bushes in fear that the boy had fallen, but found nothing.At this point, feeling pretty foolish but insisting the boy had been there, I commented to the lads about losing my marbles and left.I was quite bemused by the event and put it down to the lads playing a trick on me, so you can imagine my bewilderment when the developed photographs showed not only the white shirted boy at the top of the pit wheel, but also at the foot of the same pitwheel, standing in the doorway of the engine hall, and in several shots of the interior of the engine room!My eyesight is perfect, and I still stand my ground that that boy was not there when I took the photos.",110,6982,432,351,1,16

In Paltaniemi there was also a cemetery. Half of it collapsed to a lake centuries ago and the remains of people were floatingin the lake. The rest of the graves were dug up and the bodies relocated. Only holes remain in the old graveyard. In Kajaani an old mansion called Karolineburg is said to be haunted by a young lady.
