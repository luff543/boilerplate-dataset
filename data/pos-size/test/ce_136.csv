html body text table tbody tr td div span  ,rather than the doctrine itself:,428,4441,190,17,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"First off, the notion that a nuclear Iraq would be problematic but not inherently disastrous isn�t some bizarre notion � the fairly-insane regimes of Stalin and Mao proved manageable even once they got nuclear weapons. The same arguments made in favor of stopping a nuclear Iraq were also made in the early 1960s about stopping the PRC from getting the bomb (see Frank Gavin�s recent work on the Gilpatric Commission) and have been proven quite terribly wrong in retrospect. So maybe �wow� is one possible response, but another might be �nuclear deterrence is pretty robust, even in the face of genocidal psychopaths.�",209,4475,482,166,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"Second, you badly misrepresent Mearsheimer�s arguments, and the rest of realism�s approach to the Cold War. He wasn�t a Cold War dove in the 1980s, but neither was he a hawk as you claim � he cut his teeth arguing that the conventional balance in Europe wasn�t nearly as bad for NATO as hawks like Sam Huntington and Eliot Cohen kept claiming it was (see the 1988 exchange in IS between Mearsheimer, Posen, and Cohen for an example; moreover, history has borne JJM out on this argument). His �Back to the Future� article�s analysis was premised on US withdrawal from Europe, which didn�t happen, and so the causal logic hasn�t had a chance to be tested (by the way, it was 1990, not the mid-1990s).",209,4661,486,184,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"Third, it�s not clear that somehow Morgenthau was wrong in arguing that such fun adventures as Vietnam were not in America�s vital national interests. The twilight wars on the periphery were sideshows from defending the main strongpoints that locked up the keys to world power. It�s not threat deflation to say that American vital interests were simply not involved in places like Africa. Moreover, it�s hard to tell exactly what you�re referring to with the Cold War and realism � apparently �many other realists were hawkish then too� but somehow also were �downgrading the threat.� For the most part in the 1980s realists were arguing for robust conventional and nuclear deterrence in Europe and East Asia while trying to keep the US from getting too bogged down in the Third World. Europe mattered, while the Third World only did in certain areas and in certain ways. A mixture of hawkishness and dove-ishness.",209,4865,481,239,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"Fourth, I don�t understand your critique of defensive realism as ignoring the domestic nature of regimes (an �almost complete disregard�). Walt writes on the effects of revolution, Van Evera on militarism, organizational politics, nationalism, and misperception (you might want to read �Primed for Peace� or �Hypotheses on Nationalism and War� or �Why Cooperation Failed in WWI�), Posen on military organizations (�Sources of Military Doctrine�), and Snyder on domestic log-rolling, bureaucracies and international expansion (�Myths of Empire� and �The Ideology of the Offensive�). Most of this was written during the Cold War or was developed during it and published very soon after. Since then, people like Tom Christensen and Randy Schweller have very seriously looked at domestic politics. So I�m not really sure exactly what your point is. Snyder and Van Evera explicitly talked about democracies as being less expansionistic than dictatorships and especially oligarchic/log-rolling regimes. Maybe that�s �almost complete disregard� but given that these are major figures it�s hard to see how. Some people disagree with them, while others don�t think they go far enough in looking at domestic politics. But it�s not like domestic politics have been ignored.",209,5124,480,335,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"Fifth, Walt appears to be right that NATO is no longer a very important alliance � the US doesn�t use it for much of anything, and the Europeans are slowly putting together their own power projection force. And if it does exist in some serious fashion, I don�t see how that�s the result of democracy. The US has been allied with Saudi Arabia and Jordan for decades too, and that�s not because of democracy.",209,5478,483,110,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"Sixth, the offensive/defensive realist distinction you make is wrong � both look at armed force as the only effective deterrent. �The implicit deterrent of alliances� you refer to as the focus of defensive realists is backed by armed force; alliances are about armed force. The distinction between offensive and defensive realism is based on other things, like the efficiency of balancing, the probabilistic or possibilistic nature of state decision-making, the impact of nuclear weapons on deterrence, the ability to signal and detect state �type,� and the impact of domestic pathologies (discussed above) in leading to war. Armed force is crucial to both, as it is to any theory of international security, realist or not.",209,5608,484,182,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"So I guess I just remain confused by your intellectual history of the field and current read on world politics. And I�m not really comfortable with you casting sweeping aspersions on the beliefs and motives of scholars whose work you appear not to have read, at least in any detail. Realists of various stripes have been right about lots of things, have looked at the issues you claim they haven�t, and have offered much more nuanced arguments than you give them credit for. They�ve also been wrong about lots of issues and ignored others, obviously. It�s always fun to beat up on �realism� but there are good and bad ways to do it.",209,5809,477,166,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div span  ,"Let me respond briefly. First of all, I think PS does a good job of illustrating that my previous comments can't do full justice to a scholarly enterprise in which hundreds of brilliant men and women have taken part over the past few decades. For those with a serious interest in realism, there is no replacement for reading actual books written by realists, rather than OxBlog's anti-realist polemics.",169,5992,549,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td div span  ,"That said, I stand by my basic points and continue to disagree with PS. Unless one is comfortable with the current situation in North Korea, I don't see how one can describe deterrence as a robust response to the hypothetical situation of a nuclear Iraq (c. 2002) or Iran today. My previous point about the Cuban Missile Crisis suggests why deterrence was not ideal or safe during the Cold War, either.",169,6100,558,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td div span  ,"Second, Morgenthau deserves credit for his early opposition to the war in Vietnam.

html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"IT is the new buzz here, but it is unclear whether it actually exists besides one sad-looking internet cafe with two computers in the 'wealthy' part of town (read: less than abject poverty). Both times I went there was no current and hence no internet, but in theory you could check your email. Dhaka still does not have a McDonald's nor any other international chain, although it does have a Dominous pizza (note the ingenious way around copyright) and a restaurant that has stolen the Chili's logo and sells Thai food. The country has trouble attracting foreign investment because it has one of the highest corruption rates in the world, exacerbated by a political system run almost entirely by two political families who trade off power almost every election. During my visit, two strikes called by the opposition caused economic activity to grind to a halt. Fearing reprisals from the organized crime mobs controlled by each of the families, the entire country shuts down. When I ventured onto the streets around 2 p.m., the only activity I saw on the usually congested streets was an occasional rickshaw.",209,14562,481,269,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"After several days in Dhaka, I traveled by launch down the Ganges River to the island of Bhola, which served as my home for several months back in 2001. Things here have changed more dramatically, but I fear for the worst. When I was here before, women did not adhere strictly to purdah and many ventured into the marketplace wearing only hijab. Now, women are largely kept to their homes and are required to wear a burkah in public. However, some advances have been made in women's health. Birth control in the form of contraceptive pills from India is now available, although apparently the local Madrassa has organized a campaign against its use (not that it seemed to be having much effect; most of the women see it as a Godsend). The island still only has a handful of doctors for 8 million people; education is spotty, although improving. I was glad to hear that in the past five years, families have begun to send their daughters to school past primary school. I also saw evidence that microfinance projects were living up to their touted potential here. Several women's craft guilds have appeared in the area since I visited last and many women appear to be supporting their families on the income they make.",209,14850,486,305,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"The biggest difference has to be the proliferation of cell phones and televisions. Before, the only telephone was owned by the police chief, who doled out phone privileges based on bribes or personal connections. Now, every third person seems to have a cell phone. The people in the area may still not have reliable electricity, or safe drinking water, or indoor plumbing, or much of anything else, but now many families do have a television. The children look just as malnourished but now they can sing Bollywood songs. Because of this, the people have a greater awareness of the outside world than they did four years ago. And the more they see of the outside world, the less likely Islamic extremism will make inroads in the area, something that it is constantly threatening to do.",209,15174,480,197,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"On the final night of my time in Bhola, I went up to the roof of the orphanage where I was staying and watched a storm roll in over the flat landscape. One of the teachers at the school gathered the children in a circle and sang a slow melodic folk song as the wind swept through the branches of the Khrishnachura trees below. When a lightening bolt would cascade across the sky, the red blossoms of the tree named for a god appeared against the night like tiny orbs of blazing fire. It was one of those moments of beauty and tranquility that, perhaps mistakenly, gives you faith in something that transcends the banalities and tragedies of this world. Bangladesh has a way of reminding you of the fragility of human life. I knew that many people would die in the floods that would follow the storms. The orphanage on which I stood was itself an artifact of the brutality of life here, built in the aftermath of the 1971 cyclone that killed millions in a matter of days.",209,15390,486,251,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"The moment on the roof was ethereal, but it was I who was the ghost, swooping in from another world to which I would shortly return. Most people here view the United States as akin to Paradise and equally unreachable in this life. Yet, life does goes on. Another child is born. Another dies of fever in the middle of the night. And another still is given a chance at making more of herself than the world ever intended. I�m glad I have stayed involved in the community since I left, organizing a program that has given some young adults the chance at a university education and a better life. The misery of the people here is only matched by their potential to rise above it.",209,15660,484,180,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div blockquote span  ,"I learned later that a launch similar to the one I had taken just days before capsized in the storm that night and 200 people died. The launch had capsized twice before, killing hundreds, and had been condemned by the river authorities. And yet, it had set out that night overcapacity and understaffed. Ironically, it was the first-class passengers who bore the brunt of the casualties. Trapped in their cabins when the boat capsized, they had no chance to swim ashore, while some of those on the open-air lower decks were permitted a fateful reprieve from death. As I paced nervously on the first-class deck the next night on my way back to Dhaka, afraid to retire to my cabin, I reflected on the strange twists of fate that have left Bangladesh permanently on the lower deck in the world today. Hopefully, the boat won't have to capsize in order for them to someday reach the shore.",209,15859,483,215,1,10
