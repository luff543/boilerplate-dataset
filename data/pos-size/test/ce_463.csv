html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,The Orthodox Christian should know the content of his religion as taught by the Church. He should be guided in studying what the Church has in its written (Bible) and unwritten (Sacred Tradition) teaching. The Orthodox Church is the only Church which has maintained from the beginning a coherent interpretation of its teaching. The Church approves of each member reading alone and in general talking about his religion. But it discourages conclusions based on the individual's personal interpretation.,199,339,505,125,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,"There are and have been many personalities in the Church who have devoted their lives to studying the Bible and keeping and preserving Sacred Tradition. But none became a leader of a new church outside of the One Undivided Church. Therefore, the Orthodox Church is the only one which preserves intact the ""Paradosis"", the written and unwritten Tradition. The Church,does not prevent the individual from exploring the deep meaning of the Bible to find new expressions. But this always must be authorized by the Church as a whole, where infallibility lies. It is important to know how freedom and authority work hand in hand in the teaching and governing of the Church. To achieve this understanding, the Orthodox Christian should know the basic sources of information.",199,621,505,197,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,"Each member of the Church, clergyman and layman, has the right and duty to protect the Orthodox faith from misinterpretation and false statements. But this cannot be done without knowing what is the correct teaching of the Church. The Bible is the unmovable cornerstone which through the centuries has guided the Christian in learning the Will of God. The Fathers of the Church, teachers and prophets, are the instruments by which the Will of God is transmitted to the members of the Church so that they might follow the steps Which Jesus Christ revealed. How important is the influence of the Church in guiding its people? The answer is in the more than 200 Christian denominations possessing the same Bible, yet who insist that their particular interpretation alone teaches the truth of the Bible. Thus they are divided. Most of them assert that the Bible can be self-taught and requires no outside interpretation while they all claim the same thing, they still are divided.",199,835,505,233,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,"The Church - from catacombs to cathedrals, from plain teaching to dogma and doctrine, from simple directions to formal administration-follows the steps which have been revealed to it by Almighty God in a coherent continuation of its external and internal teaching of the faith. There are two specific distinctions within the Orthodox Church. One is the relationship between ""freedom and authority, in the, government of the Church. The other is the system of self-governing churches. These distinctions are not very well known among the other Christian churches. The highest authority in the Orthodox Church is the ""Conscience of the Church"", which is the consent of the people of the Orthodox Church on the explanation of the faith given at times of its disputes. The general assemblies (synods) of the self-governing national Orthodox churches, made up of clergy, especially bishops, meet to decide, by unanimous opinion, matters of faith in dispute. The self-governing national churches have the same teachings, canons and liturgical worship, and, in fact, constitute One Church.",199,1085,505,269,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,"The Orthodox Christian should know and understand these facts in order to participate fully in the activities of the Church and to defend his position with authoritative explanations in times of discussion among friends of other churches. It is imperative for the Orthodox Christian to know the sources of the teachings especially when he must counteract the propaganda of those who would proselytize members of the Orthodox Church. This happened in the early Church and in the 17th century, and happens today. In the early Church, when the dogmas and teachings of the Church were not formally developed, there were many members of the church who turned to heretics, gnostics and other groups. Also, from the fourth century on, there appeared laymen, clergymen, even bishops and patriarchs who taught falsely the Christian faith. In the ninth century when the Great Schism began to develop between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church, and especially from the 16th century on, with the rise of Protestantism, these mistaken interpretations became more explicit. Against all these factors, the Orthodox Church has fought to keep itself intact to defend the truths which had been taught it by its Founder, Jesus Christ and His Apostles, in whom the roots of the Church are to be found.",199,1371,505,305,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,These circumstances demanded that the Church defend its teachings and set forth the sources with accurate interpretations over the centuries. It is worth stressing that the development of these sources was to counteract the false opinions of Christians themselves; opinions not based on the correct interpretation of the Church itself. These sources of the accurate teachings of the Church are herein enumerated in order to counteract false opinions based on individual misinterpretations.,199,1693,505,125,1,11

Why is it imperative for the members of the Church to know these sources? The mainsources of Orthodox teaching are the Bible and Sacred Tradition. The third source is the writings of the so-called Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists. The fourth source is decisions of the canonical synods, local and ecumenical, and their utterances of faith, especially the Symbol of Faith (Nicene Creed) and some of their canons pertaining to faith. The fifth source is the discourses written at the time of disputes and schisms, especially the Great Schism between the Eastern and Western parts of the Undivided Church (1054).

The Apostolic Symbol used in baptism was once considered to have been written by the 12 Apostles, with each Apostle having written one article. This Symbol was falsely attributed to them.

This Symbol not only is named after the city in which it was written, but also is known by the number of bishops present at the synod in Nicaea, being referred to as the ""Symbol of Faith of the 318 Fathers"". The synod in Nicaea convened in 325, to resolve the dispute caused by Arius, a presbyter, who denied the divinity of Christ as the Second Person of the Holy Trinity and that there was a time when He did not exist The 318 Fathers formulated the correct teaching in the first seven articles of the Nicene Creed. Despite the correct pronouncement of this synod, Arianism continued and became a splintered Christian sect, with the bishops who failed to accept the correct teaching of Christ's nature being excommunicated. In 381, another synod had to be convened to stop the incorrect teaching of Macedonius, who used Arian reasoning to question the divinity of the Holy Spirit, claiming He was created by the Son. The bishops at the Synod in Constantinople formulated the correct teaching concerning the Holy Spirit, that He was not created, but proceeds from the Father and is sent by the Son. This formulated truth became the last part of the Nicene Creed (last five articles). Hence the phrase, ""One God in three Hypostases (persons)"", prevails.

Not included here are writings of other Fathers which became canons concerning order and discipline, for described here are only those sources dealing with the faith.

html body text table tbody tr td div div p span  ,"Patriarch Photius of Constantinople was an outstanding hierarch and leader who as a layman was elected patriarch by vote of the people and ecclesiastical authorities. He brought order to the Church and increased its missionary work, especially in Bulgaria. What became another major source of the teachings of the Church is the encyclical epistle of Photius sent to the Patriarchs of the East, with the consent of the Synod of Constantinople, protesting against the innovations of Pope Nicholas I of Rome: his interference in the affairs of the newly-converted nation of Bulgaria, the addition of the filioque phrase in the Nicene Creed, the issuing of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decrees and the Pseudo-Constantian Gift. This encyclical of Photius restated the correct teaching of the Nicene Creed, opposing the filioque phrase; correctly asserted the canonical jurisdictional order of administration of the Church; reaffirmed the correct teaching against the primacy of the pope, his infallibility, the riches of Christ and the saints, indulgences, purgatory, the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary and her bodily assumption. All of these innovations of the West were among the factors which ultimately led to the Great Schism in 1054, setting the stage for the Protestant movement in 1517 as well. Photius' great encyclical restated and reaffirmed the orthodox teaching of the Undivided Church, and stands as a major source of Orthodox teaching.",199,4097,505,341,1,11

At that time, Pope Leo IX interfered in the jurisdiction of Constantinople in South Italy, where the Pope had introduced innovations, as had his predecessor in Bulgaria. The Pope sent to Patriarch Michael and to Bishop John of Tranis of Apoulia insulting letters in which he claimed his primacy over the entire Church, East and West, and that the Pope was infallible and had authority over both political and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The Pseudo-Constantine Gift was used as a basis for the Pope's claim.",199,4499,505,197,1,11

He insulted the Patriarch on July 16, 1054, by entering St. Sophia Cathedral during the Divine Liturgy, halting the services, and reading aloud and then placing on the altar a libel, a Bull of Excommunication of the Patriarch and his followers. This act of Pope Leo IX finalized the schism between West and East which had begun in 866. The Patriarch summoned a synod of many bishops on July 20, 1054.. They, in turn, excommunicated the libel, the Bull, and all who supported it but purposely did not mention the name of Pope Leo in order to leave open the opportunity of reconciliation. Ironically, Pope Leo IX had died on April 13, 1054, three months before Cardinal Humbert reached Constantinople.",199,4713,505,197,1,11

Three of the 12 innovations listed are: the use of unleavened bread by the Western Church for the Liturgy, baptism by only one emersion (instead of three) and the filioque phrase in the Creed. The two epistles are considered sources of the teachings of the Orthodox Church because they point out the innovations of the Western part of the Church made outside the ecumenical synod, thus without ratification by the entire Church body.

Hesychasm means the spiritual tendency of the orthodox monks toward a clear theory of quietness leading to mystic union with God in prayer through Divine Grace. St. Gregory of Palamas taught the difference between the correct teaching of Hesychasm and the Latin theory. This dispute caused the summoning of three synods (1341, 1347, 1351), which issued three Tomes stating the correct meaning and interpretation of Hesychasm in a dogma, thereby becoming a source on this orthodox teaching.",199,5185,505,197,1,11

Their goal was to explore possible unity of the new movement with the Ancient Orthodox Church. The Patriarch sent the first of three lengthy answers to the theologians on May 15, 1576, through the German embassy. The theologians then sent a detailed reply to the Patriarch. In all, the correspondence on the Augsburg Confession resulted in three answers and three replies. The death of the principles on both sides ended this effort.
