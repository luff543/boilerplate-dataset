I didn't open it, I just grabbed oneoff a pallet of about 500 copies.Barbara was between mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from meand rapidly read it over the next couple of daysbefore we even left for the airport.

html body text div div div p span  ,"The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and wordchoice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line).

We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of credentials, for heaven's sake). Surely ""toward him"" feels better than ""toward himself"" (though I guess both are grammatical here). Surely ""tore from the wall"" shouldbe ""tore away from the wall"". Surely a single man can't fall into aheap (there's only him, that's not a heap). And why repeat the name""Saunière"" here instead of the pronoun ""he""? Who else is around?
