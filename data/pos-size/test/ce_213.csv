html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"4.1 There are a number of measures and classifications related to employment. Those discussed in this chapter include: status in employment; occupation; hours of work; full-time/part-time status; permanent/temporary/casual status; adult/junior status; managerial/non-managerial status; employment type; and other measures of working arrangements including details of shift work, overtime etc.",105,474,663,89,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"4.2 The status in employment classification is available from most ABS household surveys producing estimates of employment, including the Labour Force Survey, the Census of Population and Housing, and most Special Social Surveys. The status in employment classification is not available from business surveys producing estimates of employee jobs. However, as discussed in",105,639,642,89,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,4.3 The Australian status in employment classification is based on the ILO's resolution (Fifteenth ICLS 1993) concerning the International Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE-93). The ICSE classifies job holders according to the type of economic risk held between the job holder and other persons or legal organisations. The distinction between paid employment jobs and self-employment jobs is central to the classification. Paid employment (employee) jobs are those where remuneration is not directly dependent on the profits of the unit for which the job holder works. Self-employment jobs are those jobs where remuneration depends directly on the profits (or future profits) derived from the goods and services produced. The ICSE distinguishes five groups: employees (paid employment jobs) and four types of self employment jobs: employers; own account workers; contributing family workers; and members of producers' cooperatives.,105,783,663,197,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"4.4 The Australian status in employment classification classifies job holders according to their perception of the relationship between themselves and the enterprise for which they work, together with the legal status of the enterprise where this can be established. The ICSE group ""members of producers' cooperatives"" is excluded from the Australian classification due to its lack of relevance in the Australian context. The groups distinguished in the Australian classification are:",105,999,662,107,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,"4.5 The legal status concept is used to classify owner-managers of incorporated businesses as employees rather than as employers or own account workers, for consistency with Australian National Accounts practice. Individuals who work in their own business are queried about the legal status of the business. Although they may 'own' the business, if it is incorporated the individual is not held personally liable for the economic enterprise should it become insolvent. Those individuals who own an incorporated business, with or without hiring one or more employees, are therefore classified as employees. If the business is unincorporated (and hence the owner is liable for the economic enterprise), those who hire employees are classified as employers and those who do not are classified as own account workers.",105,1385,671,161,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,4.8 ASCO is a skill-based classification of occupations which covers all jobs in the Australian workforce. Occupation information collected in surveys and the Census provides a description of a person's job and refers to the kind of work undertaken by an employed person irrespective of the industry in which that job is held. Jobs and occupations are fundamental concepts to the classification. A job is a set of tasks designed to be performed by one individual. An occupation is a set of jobs with similar sets of tasks. Occupations are classified according to two criteria - skill level and skill specialisation.,105,2013,669,125,1,10

The former approach is relatively simple to apply without requiring the respondent to know details about their contractual arrangements on hours worked, but provides no flexibility to accommodate variations in 'normal' hours of work in different industries and occupations. The self-assessment approach does accommodate such differences but is subjective, and its accuracy is dependent on respondents' knowledge of whether they work full-time or part-time in their activity.

In ABS business surveys the classification of employee jobs as permanent, temporary or casual is based on entitlements to paid leave and the length of employment contracts. Traditionally, ABS household surveys have classified employees as permanent or casual based on their entitlements to paid leave. However, more recently an additional criterion, on whether an employee perceives their job to be casual, has been used to classify employees as self-identified casuals.

Part-time workers are those who usually work less than 35 hours per week, and either did so during the reference week, or were not at work in the reference week.

Employees who were entitled to either paid holiday or paid sick leave (or both) in their main job have been classified as permanent, while employees who were entitled to neither have been classified as casual. This method of identifying permanent and casual employees was simple and objective, and reflected long established definitions of permanent and casual employees used in Australia's industrial relations systems where, under the awards system, casuals were paid loadings in lieu of entitlements to paid holiday leave and paid sick leave. Changes to the leave entitlements of casuals from the late 1990s, where casuals are increasingly entitled to various forms of paid leave, have meant that the classification of permanent and casual employees based solely on paid leave entitlements is no longer appropriate. From late 2000, the terms 'permanent' and 'casual' will no longer be used in ABS household surveys to describe employees with and without leave entitlements.
