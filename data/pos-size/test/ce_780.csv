html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"Arriving at about 11.30 at Canning Town Underground/DLR station, where according to the DSEI and Wombles websites those attempting to blockade the ""fair"" were to meet from 11, our small group of anarchists (from various parts of the UK) had a rendez-vous with other small groups and decided to try to get to the Excel Centre itself as it appeared no large crowd was forthcoming.",102,755,445,44,1,12

html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"Around 2.30 we were informed that Reclaim the Streets were starting a street party at the nearby Rathbone Street marketplace (in Canning Town) and so we headed down there, however there was a heavy police presence and small knots of protestors and of police stood around for a while, some police attempting to make conversation with protestors in a lame attempt to gather information (and one admitting that ""I am a pawn""!)",102,1332,441,44,1,12

html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"At this point the police decided we were to be herded into the park and started physically dragging people through the gate.

html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"However, the police were in for a shock as local teenagers, entirely independently of the DSEI protests, started throwing stones and bricks of them, which forced a retreat of the police into the park with us, while others attempted to disperse the locals.",102,2061,443,33,1,12
html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"One local teenager said to us ""The police do nothing when our houses are burgled or there is violence in our area, they don't even come when we call them, but when people try to have their say hundreds of the fuckers invade us!"" - fucking class!",102,2105,434,33,1,12

html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"There were several instances of police violence in removing people from the road, including one man with physical disabilities who was bodily picked up and thrown into the park, and one Met police medic(!) who was so vicious in attacking protestors with his baton that he actually had to be held back by 2 City of London police!",102,2468,444,44,1,12

html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"We tried to ask what he was being arrested for and one of the policeman claimed ""assault"", but the protestor denied having assaulted anyone.

html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"In addition to what we personally witnessed, we were informed by telephone and text message of several other actions including the Docklands Light Railway being blockaded at least twice, by protestors lying down on the tracks or D-locking themselves to trains, which were probably the most directly effective actions of the day.",102,3054,444,33,1,12
html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"We also received an unconfirmed report of a truck exploding in the nearby Blackwall Tunnel, which the police were ""treating as suspicious""... no idea whether this was the case, or who did it if it was terrorism, but we did see a large plume of smoke. However other sources also told us this was a smoke bomb.",102,3098,442,33,1,12
html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"Overall the day was enjoyable, but in real terms of arguable merit.",102,3181,265,11,1,12
html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"While as a spontaneous statement, celebration and show of resistance against authority the RTS action was successful (and certainly made us feel good while we were there, unlike the pigs who blatantly all wanted to go home), it of course did not disrupt the arms fair as such, and so cannot really be considered a success by narrow ""direct action"" criteria, and the large crowd which the DSEI and Wombles websites led us to believe would be ready to storm the Excel centre in the morning did not materialise.",102,3203,433,55,1,12
html body text div table tbody tr td p font font span  ,"However it was certainly inspiring to see the amount of support showed by the local community to the protestors (pedestrian passers-by only shouted approval, while drivers of expensive cars were the only ones shouting abuse), and to see the amount of witty and creative protestors (one of the best being a man in a suit with a briefcase full of plastic doll's limbs, saying ""Wanna buy some arms?"") in attendance.",102,3269,432,44,1,12
