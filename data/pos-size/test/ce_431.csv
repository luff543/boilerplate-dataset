I did follow the procedure in the TV program by purchasing a 4 rib ""choice"" standing rib roast and had my butcher cut off the bones. Instead of using a pot to cover the roast I placed a stone baking sheet both below and above the roast in the oven. I also cooked this a bit longer, removing from the oven at 120, letting stand until 130, then taking into the crusting stage. I cut and served the roast once it was past 145. I served this with Alton's garlic mashed potatoes and Emeril's horseradish cream sauce as well as the sage sauce.Again a wonderful dinner for 5 adults and 5 children. I will make this one again.",215,579,514,161,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,"I thought this prime rib tasted great. It was juicy and flavorful, and best of all - easy!The only issue that I have with the recipe concerns that cooking temp/time. After taking the roast out of the oven when it reaches 118 degrees, how is it supposed to reach 130 degrees? I understand that the foil will contain the heat and continue the cooking process, however how is it supposed to actually increase the temperature??? I think this had something to do with the extreme rareness of the roast, so I'm wondering what others may have differently? (I happen to love rare beef, but some of my guests unfortunately didn't.)Just wondering, how crucial do you think the clay pot is? The ease of this recipe is slightly affected by having to lug a fairly heavy terra cotta pot into the oven.",215,1224,515,179,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,"My first time with this recipe, but I got raves for Christmas dinner. Here is an observation on the heat to help the next cook:1) Since I cook on a vintage 1936 Magic Chef, I used both an electronic oven temp gauge and a meat thermometer. Even though I kept the oven temp turned to the required 200 degrees, the oven temp was registering at 300 degrees -- probably due to the clay pot holding heat. This meant that the meat cooked a lot faster than I expected. Don't know if this is ""right"" or not, but the end result was fantastic, so it probably doesn't matter.2) I expected the roast to end up medium rare, but it was very rare, even though I followed the temps exactly. This seems to be the experience of some of the other cooks here. I'm going to try it again and see what happens.",215,1499,520,179,1,9

After its final crusting, it eventually reached 145, which was perfect for my taste--still quite pink, but not red.I'm not sure why it took so long: was the clay pot I was using too heavy? Was the roast too cold (it essentially went from the fridge into the oven, and the thermometer started out at 32 degrees!)? The pot I used had a dark interior--was that the problem? The roast was tied--did that affect the cooking time?We were quite pleased with the texture, taste, and appearance of the finished roast, but Christmas dinner after 9 p.m. was NOT part of the plan!Next time I make this (and I will make it again), I will bring the roast to room temp before putting it in the oven, and I will probably dispense with the clay pot.",215,3133,513,233,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,"I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Alton. A few weeks ago, we happened to catch this episode. We watched it because I always cook rib roast for Christmas. The past few years, I have cooked it at low heat using a slightly different recipe. It was definitely better than the higher heat method. But we had never aged the meat or crisped it at the end. I only aged it 2 days. I didn't do the clay pot -- just my roasting pan. Hands down, this was the best rib roast I have ever cooked. After reading all the reviews here, I left it in to 125? instead of the 118. Then let it rest to a little over 130. Then I crisped it. The roast was done to perfection. Absolutely fabulous. This recipe is a winner! I will never cook it any other way.",215,4351,513,161,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,You may need to adjust the temps though. Instead of pulling out the roast at 118 I pulled it out at 125 and it only heated to 129 and stopped. I blasted at 500 for about 18 minutes. When I took it out I took the temperature and it got up to 150. The center cuts were pretty rare. I liked it that way but next time I'll keep it in the oven at 200 until it gets up to 130 degrees. I made the Au Juise and it was great I also used the fat to make Yorkshire Pudding which was a great side dish for this meal. Then I used the bones and made beef soup. Today I had a prime rib sandwich on an onion roll for lunch. This cut of meat may be expensive but I was able to make so many things out of. Best of all the kids asked for thirds!!,215,8613,522,161,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,"Absolutely a fantastic recipe. The best rib roast I've ever had, including some top notch steakhouses. A few things to consider, though. Firstly, the clay pot is not strictly necessary, but the even heat from all sides ensures the meat all gets done at the same time. This is the real strength of this recipe...uniform doneness all the way through, top to bottom, side to side. In higher temp recipes, the outer ring of filet meat(which is the best part) is always way overdone. With this recipe it was perfectly medium rare with a small 1/4 inch layer that was more done from the browning process.Be warned, though, carry-over temp varies with the size of the roast. The smaller it is, the less it will carry over.",215,12022,520,161,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,"I have wanted to try this for some time now and finally did. Couldnt find the planter as most stores around here dont carry that thing in winter. Anyway I only had time to dry age for a little over 2 days. You have to be trusting as the meat starts to look scary. When it was finally time to cook I let it stand out for about an hour and a half (something they always talk about but didnt have in the recipe). Put in the oven @ 200 and waited.... and waited.. and waited. I think it must cook faster with the planter as it took about 5 hrs to hit 118. I pulled the meat out and it was so cool that the temp didnt rise at all. I put the roast back in at 225 and set the alarm for 125. This took about another hour to reach, much to the dismay of my now very hungry guests. Once this temp was reached I pulled the roast and covered, then started the wine reduction. This step takes longer than I thought (about 45 minutes), for something that, in my opinion, tastes very bad. I guess I dont like the taste of Sage, but everyone is different. When i cut the meat though, I was very pleased to find it very flavorful with great texture, and this is only 2 days dry aging, next time I will go the 3 days or more. Over all it was good but if you dont have the planter plan on about 6 to 7 hrs of cook/ prep time. Also I would take to roast to at least 120 or more the meat was still a nice mid rare and didnt coast to much over 130 (134 I think).",215,16834,523,323,1,9

But watching Alton do anything gives the confidence needed to proceed any task. I followed his instuction perfectly, however I could not locate the clay cover. I continued without it, and it turned out to be the BEST PRIME RIB ever!!!!All of my family raved, we now have a new tradition. Not only did we enjoy the leftovers as French Dips, I made a chili using the bones and tiny bit left. If you are looking for the perfect recipe look no further...

html body text table tbody tr td span span  ,"I've had horrible results with standing rib roasts several times in the past and was largely discouraged by the tough and fatty results and the total waste of money. On pure faith in dear Alton I tried it again this year. I purchased a grocery-store choice cut of meat (to minimize my losses if it was another bomb--faith only goes so far). My local Home Depot supplied the appropriate pottery, and my cooler drawer in my fridge did the aging. (I was nervous, afraid I'd end up with a rotten piece of meat.)Let me tell you, this roast rivaled the local 4-star restaurants. Alton, you are wonderful! And to the person who asked if the pottery is necessary because it's inconvenient: yes, it's necessary, and if you want convenience you can get pre-cooked rib roast slices at your local Costco!",215,18810,519,179,1,9

I also could not get the meat temp. to rise out of the oven. I recommend not waiting more than 20 minutes and then placing back in the oven at the 500 degree setting until hitting the temp and doneness that you like. I also enjoyed and endorse the link to Emeralds Horseradish sauce. My family loved it. I also like Alton's idea of saving the bones for a late night snake for the Cook,215,19365,523,125,1,9
