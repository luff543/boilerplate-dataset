html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p em span  ,Ed Lu was NASA�s science officer on the Expedition 7 mission to the International Space Station from April until October 2003. He and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko were the first two-person crew to live board the Station following the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in February 2003. The crew flew to and returned from the Station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.,123,165,250,179,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"�I had the pleasure to fly twice on the Shuttle, and I can tell you the experience in Russia is very different,� Lu said. �When you�re launching on the Shuttle, it shakes a lot. It�s like driving over a dirt road at 40 to 50 miles per hour.� The vibrations are caused by the Shuttle�s Solid Rocket Boosters. Since the Soyuz rocket relies entirely on liquid-fuel engines, it�s a much smoother ride. However, the Soyuz is a three-stage rocket, and there�s a strong acceleration when the stages separate, particularly the last one. �When that thing went, if felt like we�d been kicked in the butt by a giant.� Another difference was that he and Malenchenko were not allowed to carry as much with them on the Soyuz for their 6-month stay. Landing was also very different. For example, the Soyuz uses an ablative heat shield, which means it burns up as the craft re-enters the atmosphere. �I remember looking out the window watching pieces of our ship burn off, which is normal, but it�s still a little bit disconcerting,� he said. The Soyuz also uses a parachute attached to the side of the spacecraft. When it opens, the crew is hanging sidewise, spinning in a circle.",123,391,533,195,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"�The Space Station is like a big tube now,� Lu said. �It�s about the size of a large jetliner.� As the Soyuz approached the Station, he said it �looked like a small model. It really feels like you�re in a science fiction movie.� With the smaller crew and fewer supplies coming up from Earth, keeping equipment operational was an important part of the crew�s duties. �We spent a lot of time working on equipment,� he said. �Another thing we spent a lot of time doing was exercise.� The exercise paid off�Lu was one of the first American astronauts to return from a long-duraction spaceflight with almost no loss in bone density and little loss in muscle strength. The crew was given an �exercise prescription� for the work-out they had to perform. �And, I did extra on top of that on my own,� Lu said. �I came back with less bone loss than anyone.� His experience will help astronauts healthy when they begin making the long trips to other worlds. �When we do fly to Mars or asteroids or far away locations, it will take months,� he said. �It could even take years.� Lu said he enjoyed his stay on the Station. �It was a blast from start to finish. Towards the ending I was wishing it would last a little longer. I wasn�t ready to come home yet.�",123,617,539,210,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p font span  ,"�The food up there is pretty good, actually,� Lu said. However, while the food is tasty, it gets monotonous after a while, much like eating at your favorite restaurant every night would be. �For us, it�s 3 months before we get to eat somewhere else.� That�s why the crew looks forward to the arrival of the Progress cargo ship, carrying supplies from Earth. �It is a welcome thing, because it brings fresh food.� Another welcome delivery of the Progress is odors. �Space Station has no smell whatsoever,� Lu said, explaining that, because of the air circulation system, when you open a can of food, you can smell it only for seconds before the odor is circulated away. When the Progress docked, however, the astronauts could smell food inside. �When you opened the valve up, before you actually open the hatch, you could smell apples in the Space Station,� he said. �We were looking at our watches (until it was time to open the hatch). Those things tasted terrific.�",123,858,296,300,1,14

Ordinarily, it is difficult to see celestial objects from the Station while the lights are on, since the crew�s eyes are adjusted for the brighter conditions. �Mars was bright enough last summer that it was always out the window,� he said, explaining that it was visible even with the lights on.",123,1265,538,240,1,14
