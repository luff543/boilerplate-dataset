html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"People who've grown up with CD could be forgiven for not wanting toget into vinyl. After all, isn't it the preserve of snobbish, backward-lookingold fogeys, with more money than sense? Well, no. There are still plentyof affordable, sub-�500 turntables on sale that will eat most CDplayers for breakfast.",89,223,603,72,1,10

html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Verymuch a starter turntable, the Project .5 comes complete with an OrtofonOM10 Moving Magnet cartridge (worth �30) and basic automation - thedeck starts revolving when you move the tone-arm over the record. Althougha touch rough around the edges, the Pro-ject manages an enjoyably musicalperformance and represents excellent value for vinyl virgins.",349,473,344,144,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td b span  ,PRO-JECT 1 �199,89,645,136,17,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Aproper hi-fi deck, the 1 is completely devoid of facilities, preferringto put the emphasis on sound. Features include a precision bearing supportinga dynamically-balanced alloy platter and a good basic arm with adjustableheight - an unusual but highly worthwhile feature. The sound is fast andpunchy, with more life and sparkle than its more expensive Rega rival.Factor in the fitted Ortofon 510 cartridge and it's a tempting proposition.",349,663,333,161,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td b span  ,REGA PLANAR 2 �214,89,852,172,17,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Despitefierce competition from Pro-ject, this evergreen remains highly competitive.Cunningly simple, it consists of a black fibreboard plinth into which adecent motor and bearing are set, with a thin glass platter and felt maton top. The RB250 arm is a remarkably polished performer for the moneywith decent bearings and a quality, one-piece cast arm tube.",89,870,595,143,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"A refined and musical design, the Planar 2 sounds more mature than thePro-ject 1 but lacks a little of its brio. By absolute standards the 2'srather limited at frequency extremes and has mediocre speed stability butyou'd be surprised at how good it can still sound. The 2 has also appearedslightly modified under Akai and NAD 533 guises.",89,1030,595,71,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td b span  ,REGA PLANAR 3 �274,89,1129,172,17,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Agrown-up version of the Planar 2, this classic deck has sold in vast quantitiessince its inception way back in 1978. Although it gets an improved plinth,platter and bearing, its most distinguishing feature is the RB300 arm -a budget classic if ever there was one. Given a good cartridge and propersiting on a vibration-free support, the Planar 3 will embarrass many farmore expensive CD players. Its civilised yet musical performance is softand subtle yet detailed and engaging.",349,1147,345,179,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Although bettered by slightly more expensive separate turntable/armcombinations, as a 'plug in and play' solution it's superb. And it's alsothe only turntable available in purple - an extra �15 buys you achoice of seven pretty colours!",89,1343,593,54,1,10

html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Asouped-up Pro-ject 1, the 2 has an improved alloy, glass and felt platterand a standard record clamp - usually the province of high-end Michellsand SMEs. The tone-arm also gets a few mods, but it still can't reallymatch the Rega RB300.",349,1443,338,89,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The sound gains refinement and poise, sounding faster, cleaner and betterfocused, making the deck a truly enjoyable listen. The cartridge is improvedtoo, with either an Ortofon 520 or an MC1 moving coil for those with suitablephono stages. A lot of turntable for very little money.",89,1549,591,71,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td b span  ,MICHELL MYCRO �435,89,1648,187,17,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Anunconventional design, the Mycro is basically a paired-down GyroDec, itselfone of the best sub-�1000 turntables. Hand-built from the best materials,it features a sprung sub-chassis on which sits a superb inverted bearingand heavy acrylic platter, driven by a long rubber belt from a low-noisemotor. The base is also acrylic, chosen for its excellent resonance dampingproperties as much as its striking looks. Numerous armboards are availablebut the Mycro usually comes with the ubiquitous Rega for �577.",89,1666,593,163,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Sound is very solid, detailed and open with particularly strong stereoimaging. Bass is deep and controlled, if a little dry. Although more cerebralsounding than most, the Mycro is a truly accomplished budget design andlooks superb to boot.",89,1846,607,53,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td b span  ,PRO-JECT 6 �459,89,1927,140,17,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Thisis value - a three-point suspended sub-chassis deck with a decent arm andgroove-tastic Ortofon MC15 Super 2 moving coil for under �500! It'salso hard to argue with its alloy and glass platter, silicon arm dampingand highly adjustable suspension. Sound is strong and musically confident,with real bass and smooth treble - a major step up from the Rega class.",349,1945,345,126,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Project isn't quite up there with the Michell and Systemdek, butthen it's far cheaper when you remember you need an arm and cartridge forthe latter pair. This is the one to go for if you want a top notch, fuss-freeturntable package.",89,2088,600,53,1,10

html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"Anunusual but attractive deck, the Radius brings some exotic features tothe budget end of the market. An independently-sprung sub-chassis doesa good job of isolating the deck from its surroundings, while a decentbearing, motor and belt drive give a stable ride for the record.",349,2187,341,107,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Radius comes without an arm, but when partnered with Roksan's excellent�320 Tabriz it gives an impressively fast and dynamic sound.

html body text center table tbody tr td span  ,"The2X2 straddles the gap between budget and high end. Its independently sprungsub-chassis offers near immunity to acoustic feedback, while the expensiveacrylic platter is a superb way to support records. Although usually soldwith the Rega RB300 arm, various armboards are available and the 2X2 isquite capable of accepting arm designs costing twice its price.",349,2429,335,143,1,9
html body text center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Sonically it's one of the best affordable turntables - clean and detailedyet highly musical and dynamic.
