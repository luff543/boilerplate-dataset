html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The ability of some of the medium chain saturated fatty acids in coconut oil to inhibit the liver's formation of fat very likely synergizes with the pro-thyroid effect, in allowing energy to be used, rather than stored.",167,4442,605,53,1,18

html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"One of the stylish ways to promote the use of unsaturated oils is to refer to their presence in ""cell membranes,"" and to claim that they are essential for maintaining ""membrane fluidity."" As I have mentioned above, it is the ability of the unsaturated fats, and their breakdown products, to interfere with enzymes and transport proteins, which accounts for many of their toxic effects, so they definitely don't just harmlessly form ""membranes.""",167,4810,606,89,1,18

html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Unsaturated fats are slightly more water-soluble than fully saturated fats, and so they do have a greater tendency to concentrate at interfaces between water and fats or proteins, but there are relatively few places where these interfaces can be usefully and harmlessly occupied by unsaturated fats, and at a certain point, an excess becomes harmful.",167,4986,608,71,1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"We don't want ""membranes"" forming where there shouldn't be membranes. The fluidity or viscosity of cell surfaces is an extremely complex subject, and the degree of viscosity has to be appropriate for the function of the cell. Interestingly, in some cells, such as the cells that line the air sacs of the lungs, cholesterol and one of the saturated fatty acids found in coconut oil can increase the fluidity of the cell surface.",167,5074,608,89,1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In red blood cells, which have sometimes been wrongly described as ""hemoglobin enclosed in a cell membrane,"" it has been known for a long time that lipid oxidation of unsaturated fats weakens the cellular structure, causing the cells to be destroyed prematurely.",167,5180,603,53,1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Lipid oxidation products lower the rigidity of regions of cells considered to be membranes. But the red blood cell is actually more like a sponge in structure, consisting of a ""skeleton"" of proteins, which (if not damaged by oxidation) can hold its shape, even when the hemoglobin has been removed. Oxidants damage the protein structure, and it is this structural damage which in turn increases the ""fluidity"" of the associated fats.",167,5250,610,89,1,18
html body text form table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"So, it is probably true that in many cases the liquid unsaturated oils do increase ""membrane fluidity,"" but it is now clear that in at least some of those cases the ""fluidity"" corresponds to the chaos of a damaged cell protein structure.
