Time is all balled up in GR no matter how you cut it. The following thought experiment illustrates - you can never “watch a movie” of the formation of a black hole - since you can’t see anything beyond the horizon, that stuff can never have been “out here”, from my perspective, and therefore a black hole cannot form in finite local time, and must have always existed, from my perspective. Now the problem here is not the horizon, but time itself - and it’s just the other side of the energy problem. I cannot think of any counter-argument that allows a Big Bang. Time is more than duration, it’s “persistence”. GR is only complete when the substance - persistence - comes automatically out of the basic idea of curvature.

An obvious example would be Einstein, working as a patent clerk in Berne and having meetings with others as part of the `Olympia Academy’. Einstein must have had, or found, the time to dedicate to his three 1905 papers. Newton’s `miracle year’ (1665/6?) was one were he was, as far as I’ve read, isolated on his mother’s farm, Cambridge having closed due to the plague. Also, people like Hawking and John Nash appear to have drifted through their PhDs, waiting until the last year or months before finally focussing on a problem (and then solving it).

html body text div div ol li p span  ,"Having been a postdoc, I often wonder whether the time and freedom (and possibly lack of pressure) necessary for `great’, or major, works, is more likely to be found outside of academia, and perhaps the really big problems of the past, present and future do require a proportionately large amount of time and thought to solve. No publish or perish rule, no scrabbling or begging for funding - perhaps a menial job in the background to earn enough to live on whilst one concentrates on the `real’ work. I admit that this reads as an exceptionally difficult route to acheivement, but perhaps in such conditions the `survival instinct’ takes over and intellectual challenges become all-consuming instead of being part of the potentially droll `day job’.",48,6359,724,125,1,9

I myself believe string theorists gain funding because of links to particle theory rather than any claims about string theory being the “best candidate” for a quantum theory of gravitation. Quantum gravity is a problem that I believe is not going to be readily solved inside academia, unless funding for loop QG and other `alternatives’ to string theory QG receive more funding so that they can be explored more fully. The really big and difficult problems just don’t receive the funding necessary to resolve them, inside academia: the risk is just too great, and in consequence I wouldn’t be surprised that a lot of research becomes “resume padding”.

From what I could figure out of Thiemann’s paper and in the various discussions about it on the string coffee table (at Distler’s site) and physicsforums.com (in the string section), it appears on the surface to be a “quantization” which seems to lack a path integral formulation and looks almost “vacuous”.

If there is indeed an “alternative quantization” method which bypasses the anomalies in string theory which lock the number of spacetime dimensions to 10 or 26, it may possibly put into question all that volume of work done on Calabi-Yau compactifications. From a self-serving perspective, I would probably find it difficult to give up on all that compactification stuff in string theory if I was still doing particle/string research today.

In this case, I took care to blame Gabay, the librarian, by indirectly drawing my attention towards such pathologial matters. I know I am setting a bad example for future archeologists (I doubt it will be a younger generation of physicists), but at least now I understand why our elders were not afraid of divergences (btw, baez did some nice postings recently on borel transforms etc). As for the problem of renormalization itself, I am optimistic that it can be tamed, and it will show to be a problem in the concept of derivative. Long long time ago I heard a Field medallist to say that, of course, trivialy, blah blah, the derivative is just the simplest example of controlled substraction of infinities.",48,10461,726,143,1,9
