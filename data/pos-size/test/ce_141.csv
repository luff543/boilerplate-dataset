html body text table tbody tr td span  ,"et's consider briefly some of the theoretical arguments about taxation. Economists have produced criteria to determine whether some taxes are ""good""or ""bad."" We are not prepared to believe that any taxes are good: taxationis exaction; exaction is extortion; extortion is unjust. It makes no differencewhether Congress does it or whether the neighborhood bully does it.",20,234,716,71,1,8
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The income tax destroys more wealth than it collects. It impairsindividual liberty in the process of exacting revenue. Far from its imageas a fair tax, based on ability to pay, it is really arbitrary and discriminatory. It is not our purpose here to make some argument for a ""better"" tax. Theincome tax must go because it is a bad tax, period.",20,322,744,53,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td h4 span  ,"WHAT IS ""INCOME""?",20,398,166,17,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td span  ,"ew of us realize that the concept of ""income"" is a pretty fuzzy notion. If we receive a paycheck each week, or a monthly salary, we might just assumethat is our ""income."" Yet, the notion is much more complex than that. Justconsider — what is the ""income"" of a traveling salesman who has to pay hisown expenses? Is it his paycheck? Or is it his paycheck after deducting hisexpenses? What about his meals?",20,437,737,71,1,8
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"What is the ""income"" of a mom-and-pop grocery store, where the familymay regularly prepare dinner from meat, milk, and eggs that are not freshenough to sell? Perhaps each child in school takes an apple for the teacherfrom the fruit section. Is that part of ""income""?",20,525,734,53,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"What is the income of a coal miner, copper miner, or oil producer,who may sell coal, ore, or crude oil but in the process the mines or wellsslowly become exhausted? Are they entitled to deduct from their gross revenuesome part for this depletion, the same way that an automobile dealer deductsthe amount he paid the factory for your new car before he sold it to you?",20,595,738,71,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"One definition that economists like to use for income is the changein your wealth from one point in time to another. Of course, this idea isjust as fuzzy as the original notion, because nobody can define ""wealth""in any clear way. Is it the market value of all your property? Does itinclude the stored-up potential value of your training and education? Isyour native intelligence — or the guidance from your parents that helpedyou develop good attitudes toward work — a part of your ""wealth""?",20,683,740,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The problem of attempting to measure income is one of the main defectsin an income tax. Of course, the Internal Revenue Service loves this particulardefect, because it can make all kinds of complex and obscure rules to auditthe traveling salesman, the mom-and-pop grocery, and the coal miner. Farmershave a really good thing going for them. Most farmers can hide the distinctionbetween family consumption and business expenses without even thinking aboutit. The I.R.S. has an entire special set of rules to audit farmers, mostof whom don't have ""income"" at all.",20,789,737,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If you try to picture someone's ""income"" as a river that is flowingacross his property, you can see the analogy with the weekly paycheck. Theriver might flow at a rate of a thousand gallons per hour. Your paycheckmight arrive at the rate of $300.00 per week. The income tax, however, isimposed on your annual income. The process of taking something that flowsover time and lumping it into a fixed total at the end of a period of timeis a major defect in the income tax. Should the tax be the same on someonewho earns $300.00 per week for 52 weeks as for someone who only works for13 weeks in the summer at $1200.00 per week and spends the winter on a Caribbeanisland? Their annual incomes are the same.",20,895,744,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Many people believe that a person's ""income"" is somehow relatedto his standard of living. The argument is that ""equity"" requires that peoplewho have a higher standard of living should pay more in taxes than peoplewho have a lower standard of living. Take two people, however, who receivean equal amount of money on January 1st. Assume that one of them goes toLas Vegas and has a jolly good time eating and drinking, losing all his moneyat the tables, and enjoying live entertainment. Assume the second persontakes the same amount of money and builds a school for orphans.",20,1037,740,107,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Aside from the fact that both started with the same amount of cash,and each chose to spend it voluntarily in different ways, what kind of argumentcan pretend that their standard of living is the same? Perhaps the benefactorof the orphans was a lonely old woman who lives in a one-room apartment withthree cats. Perhaps the high-roller in Las Vegas is a blue-collar worker,dying of cancer, who took his entire pension benefit in a lump sum to enjoyit before he dies.",20,1161,742,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"It is irrational to attempt to ""measure"" the amount people shouldpay in taxes according to sociological criteria. People who regularly putlarge amounts of their ""income"" or ""wealth"" into savings and investmentshelp to create jobs and furnish modern tools and technology to workers, whothen become more productive and earn higher wages. How does the conceptof ""income"" or ""wealth"" fit the model of the high-roller in Las Vegas andthe lonely old woman, who might in fact be a millionaire's widow? Thereis no justification for taxation according to ""ability to pay"" or ""standardof living."" All taxation is arbitrary and punitive.",20,1267,743,107,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td span  ,"t the end of the 19th century, when the income tax was a major politicalissue because people (both old-rich and new ""poor"" immigrants) were enviousof the successful businessmen, anybody could theoretically become a rags-to-richesHoratio Alger hero. This is no longer true — because of the income tax.",20,1435,741,53,1,8
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If a young man today tries to work his way through college, he hasto watch the sticky fingers of government skim off the cream of his paycheckbefore he can pay his rent, buy his books, or pay his tuition. If he wantsto save part of his money to invest in a business, or perhaps start a newone, his only funds available are those left after taxes. People with savingsto invest who don't want the risks of starting their own business may investin the financial markets, or the financial institutions; but any interestor dividends earned are reduced annually by the income tax, so they can'tkeep reinvesting to accumulate capital. Ask any accountant about compoundinterest: the difference is dramatic when you see the comparison betweena tax-free investment and an investment with yearly taxes deducted!",20,1505,742,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"On the other hand, some of America's upper-class or aristocraticfamilies, whose grandfathers built their fortunes in the days before therewas an income tax, enjoy a standard of living that our hypothetical youngman could achieve only with a lot of lucky breaks and hard work. This isno reason, of course, to impose punishments on the people who already haveproperty — we believe in the right to private property — but it is a compellingreason to abolish the discriminatory income tax that makes it almost impossiblefor most Americans today to accumulate any! All spending and taxation bygovernment reduces capital formation and lowers the living standard of everyone,especially the weaker members of society.",20,1647,734,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"If a majority feel anger or annoyance because some people receivewelfare benefits from government, financed by income taxes according to theMarxist principle, ""from each according to ability, to each according toneed,"" they should look at the system of incentives as the welfare recipientssee them. If someone on welfare decides to get a job and his employer deductstaxes, not only will he most likely lose his welfare benefits, but he willbe surrendering part of his gross pay to the government for FICA and personalincome taxes. In many cases, when he looks at the net benefit of working-vs- welfare, taking both the wages received and the welfare benefits lost,the effective tax rate on the first few thousand dollars of earned incomeis greater than 50 percent!",20,1789,745,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"When you add to this disincentive the fact that unskilled workersoften have to take unpleasant jobs, the reason why so many people choosea life of unemployment is not hard to understand. This is not to say thatsuch people are making a happy choice, however, as the high incidence ofalcoholism and drug abuse among the unemployed indicates. The taxation of""income"" is just one more barrier to the development of a productive andmeaningful life in our modern society.",20,1931,744,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td h4 span  ,THE SILLIEST IDEA OF ALL: PROGRESSIVE TAXES,20,2043,395,17,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td span  ,"he modern income tax is supposed to be based on the taxpayer's ""ability topay."" This is one reason why the rates are higher on larger incomes. Thesimple idea is that for a person whose ""income"" may be only a few dollars,one extra dollar is somehow more important than an extra dollar to a millionaire. Yet, it is impossible to compare the relative values of something like ""onedollar"" to two individuals in a purely abstract way. What if the poorerperson is a Catholic monk, living in a monastery; what if the wealthier personis attempting to raise sufficient funds to pay for a kidney transplant forhis child? There is no system for making value judgements about differentincrements of ""income"" to different people — so it is just a manifestationof hate and envy in our political system to tax different levels of ""income""at different rates.",20,2082,737,143,1,8
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"In the 1930s, when steep, progressive tax rates were imposed forthe first time, politicians were using the spectre of evil businessmen asa scapegoat for the Depression. The slogan was ""Soak the Rich."" Most voterswent along with the comedy, never dreaming that by the 1970s everybody abovethe poverty level would be paying ""rich people's"" tax rates. History recordsmany cases like this, where the frog in the pot of tepid water that slowlydies as the temperature rises was the same creature who turned on the gasin the first place. A new generation of American ""frogs,"" however, can turnoff the gas! The belief in ""evil wealth"" is just so much fuel for envy.",20,2242,734,107,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The different tax rates for different amounts of ""income"" are alsothe fundamental reason why the tax code is so complex that most people needhelp to prepare their tax returns. Businessmen have to pay for professionalaccountants and tax lawyers, just to comply with a law that confiscates theirworking capital if they pay some invoices in January instead of December. Why do some wealthy physicians and attorneys take long vacations in December,or ask their clients to pay them in January, or tell their stockbrokers tosell things that have gone down in value around Christmas time? How muchinefficient or irrational economic activity is based on the absurdities ofthe tax code?",20,2366,737,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Remember the analogy of the river? With a progressive income tax,it makes a big difference from one year to the next how you can make thatriver appear to flow, even though in reality it may not change at all. Whentax rates go up or down, people jump through hoops to get their incomes ordeductions timed in the best year. If ""tax indexing"" is introduced, supposedlyto correct ""bracket creep"" (another vicious consequence of different ratesfor different nominal incomes) the game of switching the timing of your incomewill become even more widespread. Accountants and lawyers — and I.R.S. investigators— will have more work to do, and will enjoy a larger share of everyone else'sproductivity.",20,2508,744,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Best of all, from the standpoint of the totalitarians in the Federalgovernment, is the complexity of the tax code — due entirely to their powerto define ""income"" in an arbitrary manner. Economists cannot even identifyincome rigorously; accountants cannot even measure ""income"" except by arbitraryconventions, and they can interpret it in different ways at different times. When both the concept and the definition are vague and arbitrary, the Ruleof Law vanishes! How can you obey a law when you cannot understand it? The courts tell you that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Catch 22.",20,2650,736,107,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Many people who suffer from high taxation become hostile to othersin the economy because there is a perception that others aren't paying their""fair share."" How often have you heard the self-deception, ""I wouldn't mindpaying my taxes if everybody else paid their fair share."" Nobody knows whatthe ""fair share"" of others might be, but because their own taxes are toohigh, instead of getting angry at Congress or the I.R.S., their politicalenergy is diffused at some abstract ""others"" who aren't ""paying their fairshare."" This is the kind of mass confusion that governments have alwaysused to prevent revolutions! Make the peasants suspicious of each other! When one of the peasants is cut from the mob and burned at the stake, allof the rest of them will cheer!",20,2774,744,125,1,9
