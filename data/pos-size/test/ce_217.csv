html body text sup sup sup sup p span  ,"Second, active defense offers a realistic possibility--perhaps the only realisticpossibility--of reducing or eliminating the frightening specter of nuclear holocaust thathas haunted most of the world for over three decades. One approach might be for both sidesto develop massive and highly effective defenses on a scale of both quantity and qualitythat could meet and destroy any combination of nuclear attack launched against them. Byusing various weapons and tactics, such defenses would reduce the effectiveness ofoffensive systems so drastically that a climate and a motive conducive to disarmamentcould result. Such a development, however, envisions a highly optimistic evolution ofdefensive versus offensive weaponry, which is historically and logically questionable. Itwould be better to assume that if both offensive and defensive weaponry continue to bedeveloped, each will contain elements of strength and weakness with neither achievingtotal dominance. In such an event, defenses would contribute to deterrence only to theextent that greater uncertainty was introduced to offensive planning. Nuclear attack wouldbe forestalled by eliminating certainty of destruction and replacing it with lessquantifiable probabilities.",8,3267,768,45,1,9
html body text sup sup sup sup p span  ,"Another (more realistic) way of eliminating the specter of nuclear war would be fordefensive strategies to be employed along with negotiated arms reductions. Assuming thatreductions in strategic nuclear weapons will be approved eventually by both the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, it is obvious that ballistic missile defense (BMD) systemswould multiply the effect of such reductions. It is generally held that the primaryproblem with BMD is the sheer mass of incoming missiles that would have to be faced in ashort time. If the numbers were reduced, associated defensive solutions would be moreviable. Even first-generation ABMs (Sprint/Safeguard) were touted as possessing goodcapability against limited or Nth-country (China) attacks.",8,3319,758,39,1,9

Furthermore, any reluctance to take the final step beyondreductions to total nuclear disarmarnent, stemming from a desire to retain at leastlimited options to employ weapons of mass destruction in times of crisis, might beovercome. Where without defenses there could be great misgivings about total nucleardisarmament, if it could be shown that small offensive weapons reserves were useless inthe face of effective defenses, incentives would exist to continue the arms reductionprocess. In other words, defensive weapons would promote both a climate and a motive fordisarmament by eliminating any threat of surprise.
