html body text p i span  ,"I am expecting our first child in a month. I would like to learn howpeople do their laundry with baby clothes. There are expensive,specially-for-baby brands of detergents (Dreft, Ivory snow) that peoplerecommended, and that probabily means doing baby laundry separately andspending even more $$.. I wonder if the dye-free, perfume-free detergent(maybe plus one more rinse cycle) would also work for baby's delicateskin. How about fabric softeners and dryer sheets?Cherri",8,362,763,89,1,6
html body text span  ,"My son, now three years old had severe eczema. We were very careful toonly use detergents without fragrance or dyes. Tide and Cheer both haveproducts that worked well for us. For the dryer we did the same - weuse Bounce without fragrance. I have washed our clothes together andeverything held up well.",8,478,762,53,1,4
html body text span  ,"We washed our clothes separately from the baby clothes for about a week. Wehave always used detergent with no perfumes or dyes, so that was never anissue. I understand that using fabric softener on cloth diapers and diaperwraps makes them less absorbent.Laurel",8,550,746,53,1,4
html body text span  ,"What worked well for us was washing once with a dye-free,perfume-free detergent, then running the clothes throughthe full wash cycle again with no detergent.",8,622,767,35,1,4
html body text p span  ,"We had no problems with baby's skin. I think the extrarinse is important, as I've often noticed suds on theclothes if I open the washer right after the regularcycle is done. The soap isn't thoroughly rinsed out ofthe clothes in the regular cycle (at least with mywasher).Cecilia",8,674,742,53,1,5
html body text span  ,"I did what you've already suggested - dye-free, perfume-free detergent with an extra rinse - when my daughter was a baby and it seemed to work fine. Although I had purchased Ivory, I found out later that you can't use it on sleepwear for baby/children since it is a soap and will remove the flame retardants.",8,754,766,53,1,4
html body text p span  ,As for softeners/dryer sheets - I never used them because the fragrance just seemed to chemically to me. I didn't want that next to the baby.Cathy,8,824,752,35,1,5
html body text span  ,"We don't use fabric softeners for a variety of reasons. But we found thatour daughter's skin responded best to the dye- and perfume-free mainstreamdetergent (All or Arm & Hammer, etc.). Everything else, including all theexpensive guilt-marketed baby stuff, gave her a rash. Laura",8,886,762,53,1,4
html body text span  ,"Laundry soap for babies: For my own and my daughter's clothes, I use plainold unscented Trader Joe's laundry detergent. It's cheap and concentratedso a box or bottle (comes in powder or liquid) lasts a long time. I'mallergic to almost all scents in brand-name products, and the smell oftalcum powder literally makes me gag and gives me a headache, so I avoidmost ""baby"" products. The clothes come out smelling and looking fine to me,and when time and weather permit, I dry them on the line outside ratherthan in the dryer, and then they smell super, though they might not be as soft.Nicole",8,958,759,107,1,4
html body text span  ,"I never did my baby's laundry separately, but I've always used Dye-Free,perfume-free detergent for my own sensitive skin. It seems to work justfine, and I haven't ever done a second rinse.Dawn",8,1084,750,35,1,4
html body text span  ,"We have used Tide Free with for our child's clothes since she was born.(She is now almost 20 months old). We wash all of the family's clothestogether, and have not had a problem with this method. Good luck, GailGail",8,1138,765,35,1,4
html body text span  ,"I do a separate load of baby clothes, sheets, towels, etc. every week,all colors and fabrics together, with Dreft and warm water, and it hasworked out fine. My son does not have problems with his skin, so Iprobably could use scent- and dye-free Tide or the like, but have not asyet. Such products are very harsh, however, so I would want to do atleast one *warm* rinse. The other detergent we have used, both forourselves and the kid, is an environmentally friendly liquid laundryproduct, Ecover, that we get at Whole Foods or the Berkeley Bowl. Itcomes in several sizes, including a biggish plastic bottle, and is finefor baby clothes. It is not a particularly ""budget"" product, however.I prefer to do the kid's wash separately, so that I can better controlwhat he's exposed to, and it's not a problem to collect one load overthe course of 4-7 days. As to dryer sheets and fabric softeners - Ithink those are a big waste of money and that you'd be better servedbuying the milder soap or detergent. Have fun. Wendy",8,1192,766,161,1,4
html body text span  ,"Many babies are sensetive to the perfume and dyes in detergents.Believe it or not, Dreft has fragrance and even though some babies areok with that, our pediatric dermetologist recommended All Free andClear as a better option. Absoutely NO FABRIC SOFTNER OR DRYER SHEET.Even adults should really not use them if they have any sensetivities.I was allergic to them though I did not find that out till this year.Suddenly all my allergies disappered when I stopped using them.Downey makes a ""downey free"" but why bother?? If you want to talksome more, email me.Glosson",8,1372,761,89,1,4
html body text span  ,"About washing baby clothes: I've been washing all of my daughter's (9 1/2mos) clothes with regular detergent (Tide, usually) since she was born. Idid one load after she got home with Tide and tried the clothes on her,keeping an eye out for reactions, and had no problem. This has worked forpretty much all of the other moms that I know. I'd say give it a shotbefore going out and investing in all the special detergents. At leastthat way, if you do have to use them, you'll know it's because that's whatyour baby needs. Good luck!jocelyn",8,1480,757,89,1,4
html body text span  ,"Regarding detergent and baby clothes.Not all babies have sensitive skin. I have always washed both my kidsclothes with our clothes and with our regular detergent, Arm and Hammerscent free, and it has never been a problem. We don't use any fabricsofteners though. But some of my friends babies skin are more sensitive,and they use special detergent. Hopefully you won't have to.Liz",8,1588,761,71,1,4
html body text span  ,"I have had no problems washing my baby's clothes with perfume-free, dye-freedetergents; All, Tide, and Arm and Hammer all work, without even an extrarinse cycle. (I don't use much soap, since it's not as tough the clotheshave ground-in dirt or anything.) She's five months old now, and we've beendoing this since she was bornwith no sign of any allergic reaction. Yourbaby's skin may be more prone to irritation, but otherwise I see no reasonto spend the extra money on Dreft etc.Couldn't tell you about fabric softeners and dryer sheets, though, 'cause Idon't use either.Jennifer",8,1678,766,89,1,4
html body text span  ,"One more point about fabric softeners that wasn't made by responders sofar--the allergy doctor at Kaiser who treats my toddler for excema pointedthat IF I choose to use a fabric softener, it should be the kind I put inthe washing machine, not the sheets one adds to the clothes in the dryer,which work by coating the clothes (with a wax, I think) and is definitelygoing to contact the skin, even if it is scent-free. The fabric softener inthe washer is less likely to be right on the surface of the cloth in contactwith skin--it either penetrates into the fibers or is rinsed out orboth--can't remember that part of the explanation.sally",8,1786,762,107,1,4
html body text span  ,"We were both grad students when our son (almost 3) was born, and wedidn't have time to do separate laundry, so I decided to use theall free (perfume-free, dye-free (unfortunately not also expensefree!)) soap and it worked great.",8,1912,731,35,1,4
html body text p span  ,"Be sure to wash all new clothes before the baby wears them too.I was happy that this worked since several people in my familyhave severe skin allergies, so I was on the look-out for anyadverse reaction.Heather",8,1964,745,35,1,5
