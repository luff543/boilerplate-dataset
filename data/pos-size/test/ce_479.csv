html body text p span  ,a) Headform specification: - David Spenciner - We currently reference a draft international standard (ISO 6220) that has been discontinued in our helmet tests. Intention is to take the information from this document and put it in ASTM format than we would have our own headform standard. The document was balloted and there were 3 comments and 1 negative.,8,1501,759,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Negative: Dave Thom - Frankfort plane vs. Basic plane. No evidence that the Basic plane corresponds to Frankfort plane. EN960 is referenced in this document but Frankfort plane is not mentioned in EN960. If there is a reference that ties these two planes together, then it should be listed in the headform draft. If not, then the term ""Frankfort plane"" should be taken out. It was determined that this wording can be removed as an editorial change.",8,1589,761,71,1,5

html body text p span  ,"2) Comment from Jason Brand & Dave Thom - 4 typos in document. 2 pages of text and 5 pages of tables. The numbers (typos) in the tables will be changed to reflect what is currently in the ISO draft standard. Dave Spenciner commented that in moving forward, there should be some review of these numbers at a later date. These would not be editorial changes.",8,1867,754,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,3) Comment from Jacques Tholin deals with the possibility of the headform rotating on impact. Energy used in rotation is not captured by linear accelerometer. This was discussed yesterday at shirtsleeves meeting. Will wait for Jacques Tholin to come to next meeting for further explanation and discussion.,8,1955,764,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"4) Comment from Guillaume Bélanger - (Section 4) Suggests that all headform sizes should be included from A-Q as per EN960 instead of only the 5 sizes (A, E, J, M & O). After extended discussion it was concluded that this topic along with the shape geometry will be discussed as part of the next revision, since this document has passed main committee.",8,2025,767,53,1,5

html body text p span  ,"c) Labeling - Jason Brand - Jason had put together a spreadsheet of all labeling from each of the standards of this subcommittee plus two from Ice Hockey subcommittee. Some revisions were made after the Pittsburgh meeting and copies were sent to the labeling task group. More assistance is needed. The plan is to specifically look at F1446, revise, look for commonalties and then suggest labeling for "" use only for ..."" and multiple standards. After F1446, will go through remaining standards and revise as needed. Keep in mind label requirements for CPSC and CSA.",8,2321,763,89,1,5

Negative - Dave Spenciner - The proposed change was not clear. Needs clarification to add an extra step. Wording changes - should be appropriate ""referenced"" headform. An additional wording change regarding ""impact headform"". Will confirm with ASTM to make sure these changes are editorial. The changes will be made and the negative was withdrawn.Comments - Additional comments were discussed from Dennis Piper, Jason Brand and Jeff Skein.",8,2531,738,107,1,5

html body text span  ,This is not a one time use head gear. Needs to survive multiple impacts over an extended period of time. A Hybrid III head was proposed. The impact tester for the swing arm needs to be built. Low temperature test was eliminated. Test line - area of testing was expanded where impacts are expected. Eliminate max. mass specification. Headgear must protect the wearer and opponent (striker). Labeling will have to be reviewed. Discussed life span recommendation. It was noted that there is a European martial arts standard.,8,2965,750,89,1,4
