html body text dl dd span  ,I think these criteria are too tight and that number 3 should be eliminated.

html body text dl dd span  ,". By slowing heart rate, you give the ventricle more time to relax, lowering filling pressures. Also, many DHF patients have ischemia.

html body text dl dd span  ,"Another example is calcium channel blockers. These drugs should not be used in systolic heart failure patients at all, but they may help DHF patients.
