html body text table tbody tr td font p span  ,"]. Single global estimates of intervention costs are not relevant to individual countries. On the other hand, very few countries are able to estimate the costs of all possible interventions in their settings. WHO-CHOICE is, therefore, assessing the costs and effects of a range of interventions for 14 epidemiologic sub regions of the world. The provision of sub-regional estimates allows interventions to be classified into broad categories for decision-making that have broad validity across that set of countries – e.g. those that are very cost-effective, those that are cost-effective, and those that are cost-ineffective. Policy-makers can then ask if there are good reasons why very cost-effective interventions are not done in their setting, while at the same time cost-ineffective interventions are being done",195,1500,568,179,1,10

For the option of completely ambulatory short course chemotherapy with daily supervision, programme costs accounted for 33%, 16% and 34% of estimated total costs in Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania in turn. These findings suggest that programme costs can be a substantial proportion of total costs, and that the proportion may well vary across settings. They also mean that using a simple rule of thumb in which programme costs are assumed to be a fixed percentage of patient costs may not always be appropriate – although probably preferable than ignoring this category of cost completely",195,1912,574,179,1,10

Costs are presented in 2000 International dollars. The table shows that programme costs vary across interventions and across regions for a given intervention. For example, cost per capita of educating sex workers totals I$ 0.01 in SearB, whereas it amounts to $0.07 in AfrE. For a population of 100 million people, this would mean programme costs differ substantially – $1 million in the former and $7 million in the latter sub region. Variations are caused by differences in the number of sex workers and in the number of social workers required to train sex worker peer educators, and to differences in regional price levels of inputs. (Note also that a straight comparison of cost per capita across interventions is misleading in deciding whether an intervention is of low cost or more expensive at a population level, because there is wide variation in the target populations for each of these interventions.)",195,8389,574,233,1,10

Nevertheless, reported quantities still showed considerable variation beyond that reasonably expected on the basis of regional differences, and it was necessary to return to the experts for clarification and to seek the input of external data sources and expert advice. Analysts wishing to adapt the results to their own settings should be aware that they would need to seek the advice of more than one expert in their own countries before adapting the quantities of inputs and unit prices reported here.
