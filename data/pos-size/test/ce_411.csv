html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"""I�m famous for saying, �Sell the client what they want to buy and not what you want to sell them,�"" she says.

html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Michaels� ability to conceptualize an event and then exceed customer expectations has been her hallmark and a primary reason why she has produced events around the world and coveted accounts, such as 20th Century Fox, NASA, Pepsi, Eastman Kodak, Mercedes-Benz and Microsoft, continue to contract her services.",10,613,436,75,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"""I want each and every element of any project I�m involved in to have content and meaning and a personal experience for everyone in the audience,"" comments Michaels. ""In Vancouver (for the opening of GM Place), when the owners and managers of the arena said, �I want the audience to cry,� I remembered that in each and every element. The orchestration of what we did was so emotional and impactful that you could watch 22,000 people weeping as they stood and applauded. It was about how the entire event was constructed, flowing and building continuously until you could almost see hearts pounding with energy, excitement and, best of all, emotional investment. Just thinking about it still gives me chills.""",10,856,445,150,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td p font span  ,"Although she is admittedly her own worst critic, which is enough of a barometer to judge the relative success of any event with which she is involved, Michaels does have a simple formula for measuring achievement.
