It also has something of the Australian laconic wit and defiance, and it can get under the skin of the more conventional verse structures, which bear the ghostly train of the measured cadence still. As Kevin Brophy says, the prose poem is subversive. That is something Australians have always been good at, even if they are outwardly cautious and conformist. If young readers could see something of the range and scope that has evolved over the last generation of our poets, they might be more able to see for themselves how and where the adventure might take them.",127,2192,523,215,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p em span  ,"Could we start, Tom, by discussing the genre of the prose poem? There seems perhaps a contradiction of terms here. Poetry and prose are separate matters, how can you put them together and expect them to be a 'real' form?

html body text table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p span  ,"Tom Shapcott: Your statement that it seems a contradiction in terms is the point at which the prose poem began. Most true prose poems operate from a sense of contradiction or I'd prefer to say the tension between certain sorts of claims being made upon language. The basic claims are the demands of an innate lyricism and the demands of prose realism. I think the genre as it has evolved in the last 120 or 130 years or so has tried to make use of the intrinsically dramatic conflict involved. To place it in its historical perspective: the first sustained attempts were by Charles Baudelaire - works written as a result of heightened states through drug-taking. It was the urgency of getting something down, I'm sure, that made him write these as prose. He was a superb craftsman, and he discovered that something came through which was different from what would have resulted had he attempted it in a stanzaic form. There are precursors to that sort of discovery: in the English language Walt Whitman used a non-stanzaic loping structure at a time when it was a real innovation; this was based on the dynamics of the Hebraic psalms, which involve a counterbalance in each sentence. But Baudelaire's prose poems opened up further ways - they were celebratory, in other words, lyrical, but they used the language of ordinary conversational discourse. And it was through the conflict between these two forces that something inherently different came out. The French tradition ever since has explored this. In English, such experimentation was much slower. Eliot's early attempts were quasi-translations of the French, and he later abandoned the form. Then, in the 1920s and 1930s, other (mainly American) writers made sporadic experiments...",167,2564,442,485,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p span  ,"TS: American, English, even Australian poets had done the odd little exercise. from the 1920s onward. But the form in English came to a new stage of richness from the late 1950s when American poets started using the prose poem in a serious and sustained way. This was through their postwar interest in European and especially Spanish-language poetry and translations. The Spanish-speaking countries had, as it were, spontaneously fallen for the combination of vigour and violence implicit in the structure. In Australia, Chris Wallace-Crabbe was the first poet to tackle it seriously as a form. He was influenced, though, by the French prose poem, which had become a much more elegant and almost 'courtly' study in layers of irony. Through the last decade the Americans have widely explored the possibilities of the clash between the extrovert dynamism and greed and introverted idealism and despair, and the prose poem allowed them to hit the raw nerve of the subconscious - wham - in a way that had only been tentative before - say, in the work of e e cummings...",167,3136,443,305,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p span  ,"TS: Very often the 'poetic' part of the prose poem is expressed through an appeal to illogic: to states of receptivity which deny what we have come to expect prose to offer - that is, rational discourse, descriptive clarity, even rhetoric in its conventional sense of persuasion, of using language to set certain cogs in motion. The prose poem creates its lyrical frisson by pointing the reader's anticipatory glands in that direction, and then somehow working a change ... Also, the prose poem seems very much a present-tense form. It operates on a sense of immediacy: I am doing this, this is happening to me. And that's immediately conducive to a dream state, because a dream has exactly that things-are-happening-to-me-now feeling. What's implicit is that I am a passive receiver of certain things. Things flow around the ""I"". This has become characteristic of a lot of prose poetry: an observer is operated on by all sorts of things, some magical, some absolutely mundane. Often the juxtaposition becomes the active force - 'I am sitting in a car there is a blue pram being wheeled past by a lady wearing a pink floral eiderdown...'

html body text table tbody tr td blockquote blockquote p span  ,TS: No. But there's another interesting quality of the prose poem apart from that surreal experience presented with the openness of a passive dream state. This is the implicitly dramatic context of a you-and-me. The poem becomes a dialogue between writer and reader.
