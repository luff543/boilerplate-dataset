html body text table tbody tr td div span  ,"Hi,Just wanted to thank you profusely for your site. Tons of useful information (more than I got from WebMD.) Most useful were the pictures (instead of the illustrations you tend to find elsewhere) which helped me realize I had more than one kind/growing habit of poison ivy growing in my yard. It took awhile, but eventually I found possible ways of washing the oil off my upholstry (you can't exactly throw a possibly contaminated couch into the washing machine.) Perhaps, if you've the time, a ""section"" on removing the oil from more than your hands and clothing would be useful. And lastly, simply reading about others who have gone through the same suffering as much (and more) than I am, has helped mentally. Thanks again :-) and much praise for your site :-)--Heidi m., a sufferer in central New Jersey",209,5135,561,179,1,9

The problem with the skin is that once the oil bonds, it is verydifficult to remove. Not a problem with furniture, tools, etc.Anyone else?",209,5331,561,47,1,10

My 'job' when visiting my grandparents in ipswich was to fill up the 2-gal pressure sprayer every morning and roam around their 75 ac looking for p.i., and I did that for many years. Like glyphosate, it needed several applications at two-week intervals, but in my experience it was very effective. I know enough chemstry to appreciate its relative safety, and in my experience it's extremely selective, killing only the p.i. I can remember spraying it on a vine growing through a highbush blueberry and seeing only the p.i. leaves wilt. I'm very !$!#!$ that it seems to be completely unavailable now - perhaps because it's too cheap and commodity-like to be profitable when glyphosate and triclopyr can be sold instead? I'm tempted to try making it. I don't think it'd be too hard. My other grandmother swore by phenolic soap ['fels naptha'] for removing urushiol before the itch started, back in the '60s.",209,5511,560,215,1,9
