Thepurpose of this article is to squarely face this issue from analternative science point of view. Many engineers and inventors,working in the alternative energy field, still mistakenly believethat the ""Laws of Thermodynamics"" are universally true.For them, the ""free energy"" machine can only be aclever scientific slight of hand where the machine becomes""outlaw"", breaking some fundamental universe law. Forprogress to be made in this field, the limitations and errorsinherent in the ""Laws of Thermodynamics"" must beexposed. Only then will people realize that scientificexperimentation is the only reliable tool for revealing thebehavior of physical reality.",8,94,765,143,1,6

It states that""energy can be changed from one form to another, but it isneither created nor destroyed."" By the time this thoughtbecame universally believed, it had totally transformed theintellectual landscape of mechanics, physics and energy dynamics.This was a clean break from the set of thoughts and assumptionsthat had come forward from antiquity.

He states that ""in all cases in which work isproduced by the agency of heat, a quantity of heat is consumedthat is proportional to the work done; and conversely, by theexpenditure of an equal quantity of work, an equal quantity ofheat is produced."" This statement by Carnot was based onhundreds of experimental measurements.

html body text p font span  ,"The ""Second Law of Thermodynamics""evolved out of further studies of the behavior of heat in closedsystems. Remarkably, there is no one statement that isuniversally recognized as the definitive expression of this socalled ""Law"". Among the more popular statements whichreflect the general understanding of the ""Second Law ofThermodynamics"" are the following: ""In a closed system,entropy does not decrease"", ""The state of order in aclosed system does not spontaneously increase without theapplication of work"", ""Among all the allowed states ofa system with given values of energy, number of particles andconstraints, one and only one is a stable equilibriumstate"", and ""It is impossible to construct a devicethat operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than theproduction of work and exchange of heat with a singlereservoir."" For those who can fathom the language, thesestatements clearly do not all express the same idea. Some havebroad ramifications while others are more narrowly defined. Allof these statements grew out of the idea, expressed fairly wellas the last statement in the series, that a perpetual motionmachine could not be made that operated on the principle of awork/heat exchange when this process was limited to a knownquantity of heat at the start. After that amount of heat was",8,1152,766,215,1,6

This is not only reasonable, but it is backed up bythousands of experiments. As long as the ""Law"" isclearly and narrowly defined as a statement that reflects uponthe behavior of heat in closed systems, this author has noproblem with agreeing completely.",8,1350,755,71,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Problems arise, however, with some of the moregeneralized interpretations of the ""Law"" such as""the state of order in a closed system does notspontaneously increase without the application of work."" Inorder to understand why this statement is not universally true,it is important to clearly define our terms. We must understandwhat is meant by the ""state of order"" in a system, andwe must define the boundaries of the ""closure"" of thatsystem. In the first case, the ""state of order"" in thesystem is generally regarded as the temperature. Understandingthis, we can rephrase this statement to say, that in a thermallyisolated enclosure, the temperature will not increase unless workor energy is added to the system. Here again, by clearly definingour terms, and limiting the discussion to heat and work, we havea universally true statement backed up by mountains ofexperimental data. If, however, we define the ""state oforder"" as a generalized ""quantity of energy"", andwe further define the ""closed system"" as the Universe,we are led to believe that under no circumstance is it possibleto create a condition where the concentration of energy willincrease spontaneously. This is not true!",8,1438,769,197,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"While it should be understood that most knownchemical processes, standard electrical equipment and heatgenerally do behave this way, the Etheric Energy Field of theplanet does not. The Etheric Energy Field behaves in directopposition to the more generalized understandings of the""Second Law of Thermodynamics"" and this fact is backedup by considerable experimental data. One of the best documentedexamples of this is the spontaneous temperature rise observed inthe ""orgone accumulator"", invented by Dr. Wilhelm Reichin 1940. Here, a simple enclosure made of alternating layers oforganic and inorganic material, allows the ambient density of theEtheric Energy Field to become more concentrated in the localarea,",8,1652,760,125,1,6

This situation does not break the ""SecondLaw"" in the narrow case, because we admit that new energy isentering the system. It does break the ""Second Law"" inthe general case because this energy is entering without theapplication of external work. Reich's accumulator was designed asan attempt to shield and isolate this energy from its presence inthe environment. His data clearly showed, however, that he wasnot able to isolate the energy effects inside the accumulatorbecause the Etheric Energy Field easily penetrated the walls ofthe enclosure. He eventually realized that with regard to EthericEnergy Fields, it was impossible to ""close the system""in the local sense. This is important to understand because itdirectly refutes the assumption that the universe consists onlyof closed systems at all levels of activity.",8,1760,749,161,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Here then is a major problem with how thescientific community regards the ""Laws ofThermodynamics."" When the discussion is limited to thebehavior of heat in closed systems, the ""Second Law ofThermodynamics"" is a well tested and accurate description ofwhat happens under those circumstances. It is when it isincorrectly assumed that all forms of energy behave this way andthat enclosure of the system is possible at all levels, thatgrossly false conclusions can be drawn from what started out asexperimentally derived observations. The scientificcommunity-at-large obviates these problems simply by denying theexistence of the Etheric Energy Field because it doesn't fitwithin their intellectual model. Unfortunately for them, themounting experimental evidence is making this increasingly hardto do.",8,1938,767,125,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Certainly, the best evidence to date of theexistence of the Etheric Energy Field and its capability of beingdrawn to high concentrations without the application of work isdemonstrated by the Etheric Weather Engineering techniquesdeveloped by Trevor James Constable and his Atmos Engineeringgroup. As a member of this group, I have personally seen howsimple Etheric Energy projectors, that do no work in theclassical sense, can cause the etheric potentials in theatmosphere to rise to such high concentrations that millions ofgallons of water will precipitate from the air for hours at atime.",8,2080,763,107,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"When these Etheric Energy projectors aremotorized, they draw a few hundred watts of electric energy. Ifthe rain produced is dropped behind a dam and then releasedthrough a hydro-electric turbine, the electrical energy gain inthe system can be enormous, on the order of 100,000 to 1. Thismethod of creating ""free energy"" is a practical realitytoday. While I know of no community using this method forsupplying its energy needs, it is eminently practicable. Thisexample is theoretical in the sense that it has never been done,but it is a good model of other ""free energy"" systemsunder development around the world today.",8,2204,758,107,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Because the input to motorize the EthericEnergy projectors is electric and the output from thehydro-electric generators is electric, many people might mistakethis for a so-called ""over-unity"" system. There isnothing ""over-unity"" about this situation. Each andevery component of the machinery used in this system hasoperational and frictional losses. The energy tapped by thesystem is the atmospheric ether and all of the energy gain in thesystem occurs outside of the equipment. The fact that a smallelectric input yields a huge electric output does not mean thesystem is operating ""over-unity.",8,2328,762,107,1,6

html body text p font span  ,"ofconversion requires that the various rates of exchange are fixedand act as an upper limit for the calculation of a ratio thatapproaches one (100%) where the numerator of this fraction is the""output"" and the denominator is the ""input.""Since it is generally agreed that every machine experiencesso-called losses, the idea that this ratio could be greater thanone is, of course, ridiculous. This, coupled with the assumptionin the ""Second Law"" that all energy systems are closed,(meaning that no new energy can enter the system in-between the""input"" and the ""output"") makes the idea ofan ""over-unity"" system even more impossible than a mereperpetual motion machine. The line of logic embodied in the""Laws of Thermodynamics"" is flawless. The problemdoesn't exist in the logic, but it does illustrate that logicalone is not enough to reveal the truth. The problem exists incertain interpretations of these ""Laws."" Let's go backand look at the ""First Law"" again in light of our""over-unity"" discussion. ""Energy can be changedfrom one form to another, but it is neither created nordestroyed.""

The rotationof the magnet sets up two force fields that act at right anglesto each other. These two force fields are the radiallydistributed inertial frame of space (centrifugal force) and theintersecting axially distributed magnetic field of the rotatingmagnet. The area of magnetized, polarized, inertial space appearsto open up a region through which new energy can enter thesystem.

html body text p font span  ,. I will summarizesome of these ideas briefly.,8,3630,722,35,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"The ancient's believed that there were four""elements"" that all physical reality was composed of.These were Earth, Water, Air and Fire. In modern language, we canrestate this as follows. There are four ""states"" thatall matter appears as. These are solid, liquid, gas and heat.From an etheric science point of view, heat is the fourth stateof matter and the transition state between matter and ether. Hereis why. The only difference between the appearance of ice, water,or steam, for example, is its temperature or internal heatcondition. Heat is absolutely fundamental in all considerationsregarding matter because a change in heat is the only elementrequired to bring about a change of state from solid to liquid orfrom liquid to gas. In solid matter, the ""atoms"" arevery close together and they bind each other in a way that allowsthem to hold their shape without being in a container. Heat canbe added to the solid and its temperature will rise,correspondingly, until the melting point is reached. At thispoint, adding more heat does not raise its temperature, butrather causes the material to change state as the solid meltsinto a liquid. Once all of the material is liquified, adding moreheat once again causes the temperature to rise. In liquid matter,the ""atoms"" are less close together and they bind eachother in a way that allows the liquid to take the shape ofwhatever open topped container it is put in. As more heat isadded to the liquid, the ""atoms"" move farther apartuntil the boiling point is reached. At this point, once again,adding more heat does not raise its temperature, but rathercauses the material to change state as the liquid boils into agas. Once all of the material is gaseous, adding more heat onceagain causes the temperature to rise. In gaseous matter, the""atoms"" are so far apart that they will hold no shapeat all and can only be contained by a complete enclosure. As moreheat is added to the gas, the ""atoms"" become sodispersed that eventually, all that is left is the heat. Therelationships between heat, temperature, matter and state arequite complex and cannot easily be reduced to simpleexplanations. Steiner's explorations of these relationships gointo great detail, forming a seamless line of logic, backed up bya great deal of experimental data. Anyone interested in thenature of heat should study Rudolf Steiner's",8,3682,766,359,1,6

Helmholtz's idea that the nature of heat canbe fully described by the random motions of molecular matter isfar too simplistic. It ignores many of the well known behaviorsof heat and matter as well as the existence of the Etheric EnergyField. It should be considered an ""interesting""historical attempt to describe heat that is not supported by allof the experimental data.",8,4076,749,89,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"For those who are not familiar with ethericscience, it might be useful to review some of the characteristicsof the Etheric Energy Field at this time. The Etheric EnergyField is made up of an extremely fine, mass-free fluid. Itsactivity can be divided into four main levels. These differentaspects of the Ether have been called: the Warmth Ether, theLight Ether, the Tone (or Chemical) Ether, and the Life Ether.The Etheric Energy Field, as a whole, penetrates all matter,flows around and through the planet in well defined ways,exhibits elastic characteristics, and spontaneously moves fromlow concentrations to high concentrations before discharging.Understanding all of these factors has made engineering theweather a practical reality today. Many other amazingtechnologies also become possible when the ether is fullyunderstood. Likewise, many aspects of today's science that arestill confusing eventually become clear.",8,4182,767,143,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"One area of the greatest confusion lies in thefield of electrical science. The entire study of what has beencalled ""static electricity"" is just a confusingencounter with the Light Ether as it behaves under certaincircumstances. When fully understood, so-called ""staticelectricity"" will be seen to be neither static norelectricity. Normal electricity always flows from high potentialto low potential and usually requires metallic conductors to flowalong. On the other hand, ""static electricity"" does notdischarge in the same way, and readily moves and collects on bothconductors and insulators. Because ""static electricity""behaves more like ether than electricity, I am going coin a termfor this form of energy when it is present in wires and circuits.I call it ""ETHERICITY"", to distinguish it fromelectricity all together.",8,4342,760,125,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"In some ways, ethericity behaves likeelectricity and in some ways it behaves differently. This hasbeen the source of confusion. Up until now, most people havethought that there was only one kind of energy moving inelectrical style circuits. This can now change. Electricappliances are designed to run on the discharge of electricpotential from high to low, as in the draining of a battery topower a load. Properly designed circuits employing ethericity runthe appliance on the charging phase, as the energy spontaneouslymoves from low potential to high. Once the behaviors ofethericity are clearly understood, it will be just as easy to runmotors and lights from this source as we now do on electricity.In the 1940's, Dr. Wilhelm Reich demonstrated both lighting andmotoring effects running on the Etheric Energy Field that hetapped using his ""orgone accumulators"" and specialcircuitry. But many other ways have been discovered to harnessethericity. The patent office has many designs of so-called""electrostatic"" motors on file that work quite well.They all run on ethericity, including some powered by circuitsset up between the ground and a wire suspended high in the air.Many types of capacitors will spontaneously charge up on dayswith low relative humidity. This, too, is the classic appearanceof ethericity. I have seen how an ""electrostatic""generator failed to do anything, one humid morning, until themoment that sunlight fell on the metallic surfaces. It thenjumped to life. This was one of the most convincingdemonstrations I have ever seen that ""staticelectricity"" (ethericity) is related to light (the LightEther).",8,4484,760,251,1,6

Etheric Energy can be accumulated without theexpenditure of work, and then released in controlled ways toperform work, in properly engineered systems. Understanding thisfact presents engineers and inventors the clearest and mostdirect path to follow. Systems that precipitate heat directlyfrom the ether have already been demonstrated in Dr. Reich'saccumulator. Placing one of these accumulators over a moving bodyof water increases the precipitation of heat dramatically. Thisis a rich vane of truth waiting to reveal its secrets to thesystematic researcher. Likewise, power circuits that run onethericity for lighting and motive power are waiting to beperfected.",8,5024,755,125,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Researchers in the ""free energy""field should not concern themselves with the ideas presented asthe so-called ""Laws of Thermodynamics"". The ""FirstLaw"", with its ideas of conversion and conservation, isessentially incorrect. There is no way to convert mechanicalenergy into etheric energy, actually make one into the other.This one example is enough to disprove the universalinterpretation of the conversion idea all together. Beyond this,the energy forms that can be transmuted by the action of certainkinds of machines, apparently do so within a wide range ofactivity, depending on the geometry of the machine. This throwsinto question the idea of conservation, especially localconservation. These experimental findings render the ""FirstLaw"" without any basis in fact. The real universe does notbehave in accordance with these ideas.",8,5166,766,143,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"In the narrow case, the ""Second Law""is really only a statement which describes the behavior of heatunder certain circumstances. This much is basically true, as itis founded on experimental observation. In the general case,however, the ""Second Law"" is an intellectualextrapolation that does not accurately describe the behavior ofphysical reality under all circumstances. It embodies anerroneously concept of a mechanical universe which mysteriouslyburst forth (Big Bang) as a fully wound spring that has beenunwinding ever since (""in a closed system, entropy does notdecrease""). It is a lifeless, empty vision that ignores theSource of the energy it started with and closes the minds of itsadherents to the solutions at hand.",8,5326,764,125,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Learning how to tap the non-thermodynamicforces in nature is the hope of the future. A modern societyneeds light, heat, and motive power, all of which can be deriveddirectly from the Etheric Energy Field without consuming limitedphysical resources owned by monopoly interests.",8,5468,736,53,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"In this society, theoretical science has beenelevated to a very high level of prestige. Under this system ofbelief, the real needs of humanity have not been well served. Itis time that these incorrect theories be carefully examined anddiscarded, so that experimental science can once again take theleading role in defining the nature of physical reality. Onlythen will Etheric Science be free to offer its bounty ofsolutions to a desperate and waiting world.",8,5538,768,71,1,6
