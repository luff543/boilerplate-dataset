html body text p span  ,"It�s been (50) years since the U.S has went to Europe + butchered other Europeans(note: the last being nazi-occupied Germany). Ironically the U.S. got involved in worldwar II for the same reason why they�ve gotten involved with Kosovo. It was O.K. forthe demon Hitler to hit neighboring fronts like Poland, Denmark, Italy and even France.But, once he�d started to hit Britain with �fly-by�s� it had become awhole other story. it was O.K. for Hitler�s government to butcher millions ofso-called �undesirables� in Germany while still trading with the U.S dictators.But, once he�d began to bomb + butcher Britain/England, again, it had become a wholeother story. The U.S. felt that it�s mad-brother Hitler had made a violatable move bypounding on the �mother land� of the pirates, pilgrims, + settlers who�dstolen the land from the natives 400-odd years ago in what�s now called�America�. These �outcasts� were considered the scum of England, yetit didn�t take away the fact that the average Euro-settler in the U.S. is a directdescendant of England/Britain. Thus; Hitler had violated by �slapping� the U.S.dictators mother (i.e. Britain/England). Thus; he had to be dealt with and he was.

Using the invasion of the Turkish (Turkey) Empire hundreds of years ago ashis excuse for butchering not only the men, but babies, women, + elders. Three of the mostvulnerable targets in any war. Giving his troops the O.K. to cross over to neighboringregions + taking over. Sounds familiar?",8,4439,766,71,1,5

html body text p span  ,"Because the massacre had gotten too wide spread + other parts of Europe were beginningto receive some �disturbing� news about Kosovo.

Unlike regions of colorwho are barely allowed to plug into such media-satellites, let alone launch their ownmedia-satellites into space. The U.S had begun to see that slowly but surelyMilosevic�s government was moving closer + closer towards other European regions.Thus; causing more than just �local� strife in that region. The so-calledpresident/representative of the U.S. had made it clear during his national address on theday before he�s given his trained butchers/military the O.K. to launch a bombingcampaign on Kosovo, that the U.S. was concerned about an �united Europe� + thatMilosevic was dividing the Europeans house.

html body text p span  ,"Why would one species need the milk of another species? Cows drink cow�s milk,goats drink goat�s milk, dogs drink dog�s milk. So, shouldn�t human beingsdrink human being milk? That would seem more logical than humans drinking cow�s milkor goat�s milk. How common is it for a lion to drink milk from a female zebra?It�s just not within its nature to do so. Picture a human being being breast feedingor being breast fed by a cow or goat. How silly does that seem? How many full grownanimals (e.g. bears, dogs, deer, lions, mooses, cows) do you know of that drink milk?",8,12321,760,109,1,5

Let�s use some common sense for a moment.... When achild is born its little bones aren�t quite strong enough. This is why it is unableto stand on its own or hold certain object of weight. This is also why the child must bebreast fed by its mother to receive the calcium it needs for stronger bones anddevelopment. Once the child reach 10-12 months old, its bones are usually strong enough tosupport its body weight, walk, and hold heavier objects, thus the child soon out grows theneed to be breast fed.",8,12448,767,128,1,5

All these things can bedetermined by the structure of our brain and nervous system and also by brain chemistry.These factors are for the most part independent of direct socialization, but they do notdetermine morals, values, and ethics.

Takeethics in particular; the standard of what is right and just as distinct from wrong andevil. One may well know that certain activities are wrong �according to the law andthe mainstream moral standards�, but in his/her �own community and culture�these activities are prevalent and accepted practices, and eventhough one knows that theyare illegal and immoral, because of the manner in which they are portrayed, consciouslyand subliminally, the propensity for one to partake in these activities is much greater.There are many variations, and one rule doesn�t apply to each and every individualsituation, but the only way you can miss my point is to be mentally deficient or either inextreme denial.

The opponents of my theory would have to argue that it is nature, becausethey are opposed to the theory of nurture (socialization) as a cause of one being bad,evil, a social menace, etc. Now, if a person is bad by nature as opposed to nurture, howcan they be held accountable for their bad conduct? Think critically before attempting toanswer this question if you�ve never ventured on these grounds before. If a person isindeed a bad or evil person, I personally do not believe that it is by nature. I stand onthe theory of socialization. This is not a crutch, an excuse, a scapegoat, etc.; it�sa fact.

Now you may ask, �why would I worry aboutbeing negatively indoctrinated if the system is socialist?� The answer: Eventhough asystem may be socialist, in the interest of the populous, there is always a latent forcelurking internally and/or externally seeking to overthrow the status quo. There arecontradictions to everything. This is the law of dialectics.
