Jupiter rotates quite rapidly, and some of the features you'll be sketching may rotate out of view if you take longer than about 20 minutes. Sketch the positions of the equatorial belts and polar regions first. Carefully estimate their widths and extent and where, in terms of latitude, they begin and end. Next, place the less apparent belts and zones on your sketch as they appear on the planet. Work on one hemisphere at a time. Next, place features within the belts and zones using Jupiter's central meridian (an imaginary line from top to bottom) to help you gauge the distances. Finally, carefully shade your sketch to duplicate what you see. One technique some observers say works to bring out additional detail on Jupiter is to focus the eye on a spot halfway between one of the poles and the equator — but don't actually look at the spot.

This is the angle, measured from north through east, of the fainter of the pair (the ""companion,"" or ""secondary"") from the brighter (the ""primary""). For instance, if the companion is due north of the primary, its position angle is 0°. If it is due east, 90°, and if midway between south and west, 225°.",148,2409,512,161,1,21

Determine the longest path for the stars you see drifting through the field. This is your east-west line. The north-south line is perpendicular to it, and to find it, turn the drive back on, center a reasonably bright star, release the declination lock on your drive, and move the telescope by hand toward the north. As you observe the field of view, the bright star will be heading out, toward the south. Reverse this if you are located in the Southern Hemisphere.

I remember participating in Messier marathons in the early 1970s. In 1974, from the reasonably well-lit campus of the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, a friend and I logged 106 Messier objects in one night using his 6-inch Newtonian reflector. Since then, I've seen all 110 in one night more than a dozen times.",148,3687,515,125,1,21

Polakis's numbers are for 33° north latitude, and they get more favorable as you work your way south. The beginning of the season is about March 17. The Messier marathon season ends on April 3. Remember, however, that you can't just go out and observe the Messier objects on all those dates. The second limiting factor is the Moon. Its phase must be within a day or so of New Moon.",148,3867,510,125,1,21
