Not onlyhave I found Slackware to be more secure, with less exploits, I have foundit even easier to get the updates and install them with-in little time. Ido have to state that Jon did make a large accident by stating thatSlackware did not have any mailing lists etc, especially since he is doing so without even using Slackware him self, which at least he washonest about. The Slackware Linux developement team puts a lot of time into making surethe distribution is as secure as posible before releasing it, andpersonaly I think if Redhat put a little more time into do the same beforereleasing each dist. it might be a bit more secure it's self. Maybe I ambias to Red Hat because I have seen it hacked so many times and at thesame time not very many people can hack Slackware, or maybe it's just myexperiance with Slackware that has drawn me to it, I am not sure. Onethings for certain though, Slackware does have less exploits released foreach of there distributions.Finaly, the only thing I have to say is I appriciate these fourms, itgives us a chance to hear opinions from lots of people on security and notjust one persons views. I think the only reason that Jon has recieved somuch flaming on his editorial is because he didn't take the time to thinkthat before you judge something you should use it your self. Many peopleare opinionated on which Linux system people should use, as hard as thatis to believe, and tend to take things to the extreme when someone makescomment on it. I guess in a sense I am one of those people as well, butas I have used Red Hat, Debian, OpenBSD, SCO, Solaris, and many other *nixoses, I feel that my decision in a *nix OS is an educated decision.Cheers,The Bugroot@linuxbug.net",13,13840,1185,197,1,10

End users have more importantthings to do (as far as the company is concerned) than monitoring patchesfor their OS.

html body text div table tbody tr td p span  ,"I can not believe someone that has been in the job area for anytime wouldmake those assumptions about Slackware. It is by far the most secureflavor out there. And there are lists and sites for Slackwarewww.slackware.com and www.linuxmafia.org just to name two. When I do acomparison of changelogs I see RH has about 10+ security fixes and growingfast Slackware only has 2. In the 5.2 vs 4.0 we saw about 30vs3 . Redhat isgood mind you but should be saved for the workstation or webserver with nousers type install. As long as they try and change programs from theoriginal authors intent they will have this problem they taint about 40%of the apps included if you look at the odd ball versions they give them. Slackware on the other hand uses programs as is and does virtually nomodifications which always seems to get RH in trouble. They have thismindset that once they ""brand"" a program the user thinks its going to bebetter I this is almost never the case and alot of this is done by what Icall ""KTWFF"" Kids That Work For Free. As for the others Mandrake isnothing more than a modified RH and falls into the same catagory Debian ispretty good about security but also gets prone to the above but is stillmuch better. Sorry to flame on so much but the public is so miss-informedthat it just scares me sometimes and the RH jaugernaut scares me also. Ihave been in this biz for some years now and when I get hired for consultand I find they are running RH that is the first thing to go I dont knothave the time to try and keep up with it.
