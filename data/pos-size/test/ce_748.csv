html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div div span  ,"We consider this matter to be of the utmost urgency, with the most essential legal and moral values at stake. We understand that Princeton University has refused to approve recognition for a Christian student organization, Princeton Faith and Action (PFA), because: (1) the group is affiliated with an outside religious organization not recognized for chaplaincy by the university and (2) the dean of religious life believes that the members of PFA can work with already existing groups that do �similar things.� FIRE also understands that Princeton requires all religious student groups that seek to gain official recognition get an arbitrary �approval� from the dean of religious life before being permitted to apply for recognition. These violations of Princeton�s own written guarantees of freedom of speech, association, and religion are inexcusable at one of the nation�s leading liberal arts institutions.",214,636,360,327,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div div span  ,"The following is our understanding of the facts, drawn from student reports and other sources.

Between January of 2002 and the autumn of 2004, Bennett had corresponded with Dean of Religious Life Thomas Breidenthal to discuss the process of attaining recognition for Christian Union as a campus chaplaincy at Princeton. During their correspondence, Dean Breidenthal never gave Christian Union an opportunity to submit an official application for chaplaincy as outlined in the university�s �Policy Statement Regarding Recognition of Campus Ministers,� nor was the group�s potential for chaplaincy evaluated based on the criteria listed in that policy.",214,1072,361,253,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"In September of 2004, Dean Breidenthal informed the Reverend Richard Linderman, a Christian Union Advisory Board member, that he had decided not to recognize Christian Union for chaplaincy. Dean Breidenthal stated that the reasons for this decision were that: (1) Christian Union was a relatively new organization and needed to develop a track record; (2) another campus chaplain had complained about Christian Union scheduling a Bible study at the same time as one of that chaplain�s meetings; and (3) Christian Union had met with Vice President of Campus Life Janet Dickerson without first notifying Dean Breidenthal.",214,1326,362,234,1,13

Dean Breidenthal informed MCF that it could not host Christian Union�s Sunday event because it would be a �violation of University policy� to reserve the room for an �outside group.� Dean Breidenthal instead directed MCF to tell Christian Union to reserve a room through Princeton�s Conference Services. Christian Union attempted to do so, but its request was denied because Conference Services required that the organization have prior approval from the dean of religious life.",214,1561,362,273,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Since Christian Union could neither attain recognition as a chaplaincy nor reserve spaces on campus, by March of 2005 Princeton students associated with Christian Union had organized into a group called Princeton Faith and Action (PFA) in order to seek recognition as an official student organization. When the group�s leaders approached the Student Government Student Group Recognition Committee (SGRC) to apply for official recognition, they were instructed to meet with Dean Breidenthal to get his approval first.",214,1835,362,180,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"On April 7, 2005, Cameron Young and Rachel Blair, the president and treasurer of PFA, respectively, met with Dean Breidenthal to discuss recognition for PFA. At the meeting, Dean Breidenthal denied PFA approval to apply for recognition with the SGRC. His reasons were that (1) recognizing PFA would mean �recognizing Christian Union de facto� and (2) the members of PFA could engage in similar activities with existing campus religious groups.",214,2016,361,163,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"When the students asked Dean Breidenthal why recognizing Christian Union would be a problem, he told them that the issue was �confidential� and refused to discuss it. He further told them that he did not want PFA to become an �arm of the Christian Union on campus.� When the students pointed out that other religious student organizations existed on campus without corresponding recognized chaplaincies, the dean stated that his hope was for such groups (such as the Seventh-Day Adventists and the Muslim student group) to eventually become campus ministries with full-time chaplains.",214,2180,359,218,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"The dean suggested that, as an alternative, the students work with MCF to organize their activities.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"At the close of the meeting, the students expressed concern that requiring religious student groups to gain special approval was discriminatory since other student groups do not have the same requirements.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div span  ,"Dean Breidenthal�s decision to forbid PFA from associating with the ministry of its choice denies PFA members the right of free association and threatens the freedoms of association and religion of all of Princeton�s students.
