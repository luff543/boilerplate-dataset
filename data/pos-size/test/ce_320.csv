This dual evolution has led in some countries, the United States in particular, to a pharmaceutical statute for the institutions preparing the products.

html body text p i font span  ,"Initially designed to correct a partial loss of blood volume, transfusion was in the beginning an injection of whole blood. The only indication at the time, haemorrhage, seemed to logically call for this kind of global compensation. However, progress in the technology of resuscitation during World War II, revealed that the most threatening characteristic of a haemorrhage is a collapse of circulation due to a drop in blood volume. The idea was born of replacing as a priority the missing volume with plasma only, if necessary. Plasma, once separated from blood cells can be easily stored and preserved. The advantage therefore is greater availability. Once blood volume has been restored, the loss of red blood cells has to be compensated, but it is then only necessary to inject cells in the concentrated form which is the result of fractionation. Thus, the concept of selective transfusion began to emerge in the 1960s.",8,3460,768,161,1,7

html body text p i font span  ,"In each of these cases, it seemed logical to inject only the missing component. Furthermore, selective transfusion saves blood. Various therapeutic products can be derived from the same blood donation.",8,3708,719,35,1,7

html body text p font span  ,"Equipment required for each of these two kinds of procedures varies considerably. Production of labile products does not require any very complex equipment. It can be done by most blood transfusion centres. Plasma fractionation, however, requires complex machinery. You could say that labile products can be prepared in an unsophisticated environment, processed and used in unit form, but with all the problems of verifying compatibility at the time they are used. On the contrary, stable products fall into the category of industrial processes in batches of several thousands of litres of plasma. These products are standardised and can be used by anyone following prescriptions for indications and general administrative procedures.",8,3932,748,125,1,6
html body text p font span  ,The development of plasma fractionation activities has led to the creation of industrial facilities processing plasma in gigantic quantities : several hundreds of thousands of litres a year.,8,4074,746,35,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"Initially, plasma was the result of separation of the cell components from whole blood; it was a kind of ""by-product"" of the preparation of labile products by blood transfusion centres. But as the growth of demand for stable fractions outpaced the growth of demand for labile products, the result was selective collection. Certain machines can, during the collection of blood from a donor, separate the cellular components which are re-injected, and keep only the plasma. This is called plasmapheresis and allows for collection of larger and much more frequent donations than is the case with whole blood.",8,4126,755,107,1,6

Firstly, because there are two types of transfusion centres, those run by the Red Cross, and others with widely differing statutes. Only the first category apply the ethical principles of non payment of donors, and non-profit for the centre. But the major specific characteristic of the country is the enormous development of a plasma industry run by a few large companies along commercial lines.

As these companies are very dynamic they produce quantities far higher than are needed on the American home market (needs are evaluated at about 3 000 000 litres of plasma whereas about 9 000 000 litres are drawn). As a result, they export a great deal of their production at prices which on the whole are significantly lower than those practised by fractionating centres using donated plasma. This is because as ""donors"" are paid, conditions are imposed on them which ensure better productivity from the plasmapheresis machines and blood centre staff.",8,4498,759,125,1,6
html body text p font span  ,"For a long time, Japan imported blood products from the United States for two reasons : essentially because not enough blood was collected, but even more because consumption was excessive, particularly of plasmatic products.

The French system with centres as part of a public service exercising a monopoly is an exception. In certain countries, such as Belgium, Holland, and Denmark, the Red Cross is in charge of organising blood transfusion and sees to it that the rules of unpaid donation and absence of profit are respected. However, in certain countries, Germany in particular, paying the donor is not prohibited. Another particularity of the country, is that Germany consumes vast quantities of plasma, albumin, and antihemophilic factors, and therefore imports large volumes of American plasma (800 000 litres annually). Globally, Europe just about satisfies its domestic market for labile products. For plasmatic products however, it must import abundant quantities either as plasma, or as finished products.",8,4780,763,161,1,6

Even when they are identified and can be detected, there is always a residual risk (at present, the risk of HIV transmission is estimated at 1 in 100.000 to 1 in 200.000 transfusions).

html body text p font span  ,"Apart from a more selective choice of indications, another trend is to find new methods to either replace blood with artificial substances (as we have seen previously, plasma substitutes to replace blood volume), or to use the patient's own blood for a transfusion instead of blood supplied by a donor.

They are pure proteins, clearly identified and it is thought there could be hopes of creating them by genetic engineering. Two American firms have already manufactured a factor VIII which is out of the experimental stage and awaiting approval. The French National Transfusion Centre is also working on a factor VIII but is a little less advanced. Requirements for plasmatic factor VIII, which was the component which conditioned the level of plasma consumption, should take a sharp downward turn over the next few years.

It would remain the responsibility of the national transfusion system, thereby increasing the deficit. But the most threatening outcome concerns voluntary donors who would cease to feel concerned if the principle of voluntary donation was dropped. They have made this sentiment known through their associations.",8,8063,769,125,1,6

html body text p font span  ,"Also, the purchase of blood increases possible risks of contamination either by infectious agents, or by drugs, in two ways : there is a higher representation of the more deprived sectors of the population who are more exposed to risks of contamination of various kinds, and vendors are more likely to conceal risk factors.",8,8469,763,53,1,6

Thus, liability for risks which are difficult to foresee and estimate are becoming increasingly troublesome to insure.
