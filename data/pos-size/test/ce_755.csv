html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td span  ,"The relationship between the 21st century customer and supplier is a complex one. It was never straightforward, and events over the past fifty years or so have complicated it still further - although at the same time providing new ways of nurturing it. Over this time the face of marketing has changed beyond recognition. The 1950s and 1960s saw mass marketing at its peak. After the austerity of the war years, stores filled up with goods that consumers bought enthusiastically. But mass marketing had its disadvantages. It was almost totally untargeted, making it both costly and wasteful. It was indiscriminate, attracting as many 'cherry picking' customers as good customers. It depended on one-way communication: no feedback was received and no relationship was formed.",54,572,524,179,1,21

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Then they were all squeezed from another side. In some countries, retail space was growing at a faster rate than the population, which meant that it became more difficult and more expensive to attract new customers. In some of the major sectors discounters moved in, drawing yet more customers from the high street retailers. Suddenly, it made sense to retain regular customers rather than simply relying on new ones turning up. But how could organisations with thousands or even millions of customers apply the principles of mom and pop marketing to their massive empires? Well, once the case for the value of nurturing loyal customers was made, it began gathering momentum.",54,786,525,161,1,22

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"In 1990, The Harvard Business Review printed an article entitled 'Zero Defection: Quality Comes to Services', which eloquently argued the case for increasing profits by decreasing the rate at which customers defect. By retaining just 5% more of its customers, the article showed how a company could almost double its profits. Furthermore, in a period of only five years, a firm with a 70% customer retention rate will have lost 2 - 3 times as many customers as a firm with a 90% retention rate. It pays to engender loyalty.",54,982,525,125,1,22

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Loyalty programmes are known for some of their more obvious effects - such as increasing spend (and therefore customer lifetime value), and better retention - but they can also achieve a number of other things that impact the company's business strategy, operational efficiency, human resources policy, and more. For example: customer acquisition, up-selling and cross-selling, intelligent deselection (getting rid of unprofitable customers), winning back defected customers, selection of new outlet locations, reducing advertising costs, stock planning and merchandising, getting competitive responses right first time, setting pricing policies, building lasting relationships, and enabling true 'best customer marketing'.",54,1142,514,179,1,22

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"Loyalty is an abstract concept - there is no single complete definition of it. It comes in different types and different degrees. Customers are loyal or otherwise for many different reasons: some are loyal from choice, some are loyal because both parties have invested time and effort in building a relationship, while some are loyal because their needs are met or exceeded, and others because the relationship is profitable to both sides.",54,1356,512,107,1,22

For the majority of loyalty card users in IGD's survey, the card itself was not the key driver in store choice, and shoppers considered it as a 'nice to have' extra.

There are challenges for those companies that choose the online loyalty path instead of a systematic programme of low pricing and discounts. Loyalty requires a relationship, and the ability for the programme's operator to collect high quality, accurate data about consumers and their preferences and spending habits. But many consumers, while they are willing to give accurate personal details in-store, or on a printed application form, are unwilling to give out personal details in the online environment. Part of this unwillingness is certainly attributable to the idea that the internet is not secure, and that it is too easy for personal information to be gathered, analysed, copied, sold, distributed, or abused.",94,7684,485,215,1,23

Entire web sites have sprung up with the specific aim of getting the customer to shop around (such as shopping.com, kelkoo.co.uk, and Google's froogle.com), all of which make their comparisons based largely on price and availability rather than on service, loyalty programmes, or relationship benefits.

So much depends on the way the car is sold and particularly the way that the after sales contacts and service are carried out. It's quite possible that it's for this reason that research shows less loyalty to dealers than to manufacturers. To build loyalty to the marque, the manufacturer has to produce an attractive, desirable, reliable vehicle at the right price.

Many of the initial programmes were quite rudimentary and collected no useful customer data. Some gave a gift when a certain amount was spent on fuel - for example, a free drinking glass for each �5 spent. Not even the customer's name was collected. Others issued stamps or coupons for each purchase. When these were redeemed, the customer was sometimes identified. There are many hundreds of forecourt loyalty programmes around the world so, in this chapter, we have focused mainly on those in the UK, along with a selection of those in other parts of the world.",94,14501,483,216,1,24

As well as losing market share to the supermarkets who have invaded the territory, profit margins have fallen.

Retailers compete either on convenience - lots of sites at convenient places, service (added value like convenience stores on-site) or simply on price. All of these factors combine to make customer retention essential. So how has the sector faired? Well, it would seem that the consumer's familiarity with forecourt programmes has led them to expect these programmes as par for the course.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The business case for any loyalty programme needs to be well supported and justified, not only in the planning stages but on a continuing basis after implementation, and during development. The application of solid mathematics, statistics, and scientific measurement is the only way to prove the effect the programme is likely to have on profitability and the customer base. And the application of regular and meaningful management reporting is the only way to monitor all the factors involved both before and after implementation of the programme.",54,16291,513,143,1,22

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The only feasible way of predicting trends is to examine what has happened so far and then make projections from that. Of course even that is fraught with danger because paradigm shifts have a nasty habit of turning up just when least expected. Who would have predicted even ten years ago that the mail and the fax would have been relegated to the extent that they have by e-mail? There is also an apocryphal observation, attributed to many different origins, about what would have been predicted had the microchip been around to help in the late eighteen hundreds. Apparently, horse-drawn traffic in London was increasing in volume so quickly that it would have been quite reasonable to predict that by 1970 the whole of London would be thirty feet deep in horse manure!",54,16629,525,179,1,22
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td p span  ,"The traps, pitfalls, and warnings of the past have always been useful for planning action in the future - the worse the failure, the more widely the lesson is learned. Likewise the success of the past rapidly become role models for the future. But at the pace with which technology, retailers, service providers, general commerce, and even consumers are shifting and changing, the time has come to use increasingly predictive science to find the pitfalls before we reach them. In some sectors - particularly those where churn is traditionally high (such as freshly deregulated and highly saturated industries) - the very survival of a business may depend on its ability to see into the future.
