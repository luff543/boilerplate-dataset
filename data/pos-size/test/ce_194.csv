html body text p b span  ,CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND CONSUMER REPORTS,8,428,495,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,Consumer reporting agencies maintain information on individual consumer payment patterns associated with various types of credit obligations on approximately 190 million Americans. The data compiled by these agencies is used by creditors and others permitted under the strict prescriptions of the FCRA.,8,462,749,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Consumer credit histories are derived from, among other sources, the voluntary provision of information about consumer payments on various types of credit accounts or other debts from thousands of data furnishers such as credit grantors, student loan guarantee and child support enforcement agencies.

html body text p span  ,"Enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was significantly amended in the 104th Congress with the passage of the Credit Reporting Reform Act.",8,1024,769,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Congress, our Association's members, creditors and consumer groups spent over six years working through the modernization of what was the first privacy law enacted in this country (1970). This amendatory process resulted in a complete, current and forwarding-looking statute. The FCRA serves as an example of successfully balancing the rights of the individual with the economic benefits of maintaining a competitive consumer reporting system so necessary to a market-oriented economy.",8,1076,760,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The FCRA is an effective privacy statute, which protects the consumer by narrowly limiting the appropriate uses of a consumer report (often we call this a credit report) under Section 604 (15 U.S.C. 1681b), entitled “Permissible Purposes of Reports.”",8,1182,768,53,1,5

html body text p b span  ,SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER USES,8,1428,266,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,Let me now turn to the question of how our industry uses the SSN.,8,1462,428,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, our industry has a duty to “…employ reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy…” of the consumer report. Further, we must design systems that accurately allow our customers to extract",8,1496,738,53,1,5

html body text p span  ,the data requested on a specific individual.,173,1532,274,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"We must accomplish this dual mission of accuracy both in terms of building databases, but also properly identifying files in our systems in the context of a highly mobile society. Consider the following:",8,1566,743,35,1,5
html body text ul li span  ,"Approximately 16% of the nation's population moves each year according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which means many addresses change each year. (This equates to approximately 42 million Americans)",48,1618,694,35,1,6
html body text ul li span  ,"Based on National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated that there are 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces annually. This event frequently triggers changes in addresses as well as last names.",48,1654,723,35,1,6
html body text ul li span  ,In 1998 there were 6 million homes in the U.S. that are considered vacation or second homes. Consumers often switch billing addresses if they stay at such residences for long periods of time and in some cases maintain billing addresses for both residences with various creditors. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau House Vacancy Survey as extrapolated by the National Association of Realtors),48,1690,728,71,1,6
html body text p span  ,These data clearly speak to the challenge our members face where identifying data often changes.,8,1778,625,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"In light of the mobility of our society, the Social Security Number plays a very significant role in ensuring data quality. Our members process 2 billion data elements a month. These elements are a combination of credit history data and identifying information. Consider the following very real example.",8,1812,765,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Where a consumer has changed a last name due to marriage or divorce and has moved to a new address, which is common in either case, the SSN is the most stable identifying element in the file. First, it helps us to identify the consumer's file with precision during this life transition where he or she is likely applying for new credit, seeking approval for utilities, and seeking to rent or purchase a new residence. The consumer expects that the consumer report will be available for all of these necessary transactions and the SSN helps our members to meet this expectation. Second, the consumer expect his or her file to be accurate and the SSN helps us to maintain the file accurately even when the consumer is in the midst of updating creditors with changes in name and address.",8,1882,763,125,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The SSN is also a critical element in producing information products, which are commonly called locator services. These services are made available, for example, to child support enforcement agencies for purposes of locating non-custodial parents;",8,2024,744,53,1,5
html body text p a span  ,[5],124,2060,23,17,1,6

html body text p span  ,and for other similar uses.,361,2096,167,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Further, the SSN plays a role in fraud prevention products. Where a consumer makes application for a product or service, information products that help the business to ensure that they are doing business with the right consumer use information products to authenticate or verify the application information. This is true in both for bricks-and-mortar business and in e-Commerce.",8,2130,755,71,1,5

html body text p b span  ,CONCLUSION,8,2392,108,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,"In conclusion, you can see by our actions that in large part our uses of the SSN are governed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, one of the most extensive privacy laws in the country. Beyond law, our members have a history of proactively limiting how SSNs are used outside of the FCRA. No one particular element of information is the key to identity theft. The underlying theme in all of this is balance.",8,2426,749,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Laws that overreach in attempting to limit use of the SSN are likely to merely take fraud prevention tools out of the hands of legitimate businesses at the expense of consumers. Ironically, to prevent fraud you must be able to crosscheck information. To maintain accurate databases, you must be able to maintain a range of identifying elements. Absent the availability of the SSN, we will be less able to build accurate data bases, to accurately identify records and to help prevent the very crime through the development of fraud prevention and authentication tools.",8,2514,765,89,1,5
