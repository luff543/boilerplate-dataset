html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"High street retailers would never dream of opening a store, then not tell customers where it is or refuse to let them in.

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Search engines account for more than 80 per cent of all internet traffic.

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"E-commerce solution provider Screen Pages head of online marketing Tim Ireland, author of a recent report into the performance of high street retailers on search engines, says: ""It's an overly complacent retailer that doesn't actively pursue market share. Potential shoppers, who use generic searches or seek specific products or product types via search engines, should be looked upon as new customers or potential converts to a brand. In the real world, attracting footfall in stores is a critical trading issue. Gaining market share in single-digit percentage points from the competition consumes much management and board attention.""",188,485,559,143,1,22
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"However, management is failing to address the issue. ""Ultimately, it's a lack of awareness.

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Forrester Research analyst Hellen Omwanda says that the dotcom boom and bust combined with the failure of online banner ads means that high street retailers remain wary.

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Improving a retailer's ranking within the search engines is not a difficult process. ""Ultimately, it's about making sure the site is readable,"" says Willcocks. This means having simply designed sites. ""A lot of retail sites have a Flash front page and Google can't get past that so the site is invisible to the spiders (the indexing robots that gather data for sites),"" says Jason Woodford, development director at internet marketing consultancy Academy Internet.

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Meath Baker says it is a case of concentrating on usability over design. ""Many retailers employ web design firms with little or no experience of building online shops. This leads to sites that are very good looking and funky, but a pain to use.

html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Although retailers should be concentrating on improving their natural search engine rankings, pay-per-click advertising - where retailers bid on keywords to be top of the rankings for sponsored search engine results - is useful for short-term marketing campaigns or high-margin products because it can drive traffic straight to your site. ""You need to focus on optimising your web site for the left-hand side because then traffic will come to your site for free,"" says Woodford.
