I have had the privilege and pleasure of hosting the foreign minister of Kuwait for a meeting and a luncheon, and had the opportunity to express the appreciation of our country and the American people for the steadfast support that Kuwait has offered in this coalition effort, both with respect to the global war on terrorism and certainly with respect to Operation Iraqi Freedom.",40,446,547,89,1,27
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"I should also add that we expressed our appreciation to the minister, His Excellency, for the significant humanitarian assistance which Kuwait is offering. They have, with the United Kingdom, built a pipeline into Iraq that's now delivering some 2 million liters of fresh water per day. Their Kuwaiti relief organizations have sent dozens of trucks with food and medicine and water to a number of Iraqi cities. Kuwait has set up a humanitarian operations center to serve as a focal point for funneling aid into Iraq, and it's providing some 45,000 meals a day; in addition, has pledged a significant humanitarian relief fund for assistance in Iraq.",40,552,553,143,1,27

It is something that the government of Kuwait and the government of the United States share as a deep concern and an abiding interest. And I can -- I assured the minister that the United States is doing everything possible to pursue every conceivable lead. And we are hopeful that people in Iraq who oppose that regime will come forward and provide any information that they may have so that we can, in fact, achieve our goal of returning all of those individuals.",40,712,561,143,1,27

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Q: Mr. Secretary, a spokesman at the Syrian Foreign Ministry today denied, flatly denied, U.S. charges that Syria either has chemical weapons or is giving support to or harboring former Iraqi leaders. How do you respond to that, sir?",40,1254,548,53,1,27
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"RUMSFELD: Well, first I would say that we have seen the chemical weapons tests in Syria over the past 12, 15 months. And second, that we have intelligence that shows that Syria has allowed Syrians and others to come across the border into Iraq, people armed and people carrying leaflets indicating that they'll be rewarded if they kill Americans and members of the coalition. And we have intelligence that indicates that some Iraqi people have been allowed into Syria, in some cases to stay, in some cases to transit.",40,1324,558,125,1,27

I know the Iraqi people appreciate that.",40,1500,560,89,1,27
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"And the stabilization period, it's not possible to know how long it will be, but certainly an enormous effort is going in to getting electricity back on, and getting water working, and seeing that there is the proper distribution of medical supplies.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Q: Mr. Secretary, can you help us understand, is it correct that Ahmed Chalabi and his fighters are now going to Baghdad with the backing and support of the Pentagon or the Central Command?

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td center table tbody tr td div p span  ,"RUMSFELD: It -- the situation in Iraq today is improved over yesterday and it's improved each day. And I suspect it will continue to improve. The reality is that the coalition forces are now in a good portion of the country, but not all of the country; they're in a good portion of Baghdad, but not all of Baghdad. They are continuing to find that there are two things: Periodic pockets of resistance; firefights still exist in Baghdad and elsewhere. The other thing that is of concern is the type of thing where you end up with a suicide car or bomb of some type that is not so much a(n) act of war as it is an act of terrorism.",40,2412,555,143,1,27
