The answer is no, you have just learnt to pay attention to what your eyes are capable of.

The consequence of memory is that they can oscillate for up to several seconds after the visual stimulation has been discontinued.",232,1457,497,107,1,18

Afterimages have a precisely the same shape as original images. Afterimage of an object surrounded by its Aura is larger than the original image. The increase in such afterimage is due to the vibration of an Aura and actually represents a ""snapshot"" of an Aura. It is therefore essential to focus at one spot when watching the Aura and resist temptation to change the point of focus, otherwise an image of the Aura may become confused with the afterimage of an object.",232,1583,487,143,1,18

Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people at my workshops).
