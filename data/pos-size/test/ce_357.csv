html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"South Africa has been developing chemical weapons since the beginning of World War I. The development of such weapons was South Africa's response to the increasing threat of chemical and biological weapons (CBW) use from other countries. The establishment of the 1925 Geneva Convention, which banned the use of such weapons in warfare, temporarily decreased tensions concerning the threat. However, South Africa did not entirely cease production and research of CBW following the Geneva Convention. In fact, during World War II, South Africa sidestepped the convention protocol and began planning a more extensive CBW program, to protect the country from the threat of the Nazi regime.",154,202,317,287,1,17
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Following the war, the South African Defense Force (SADF) continued with CBW research and development, but on a much smaller scale. Much of the CBW produced during that time was tear gas, CX powder and mustard gas. The non-lethal agents were utilized mostly to control crowds.",154,506,316,107,1,17
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"It was not until the 1970's that South Africa's CBW program began stepping up production of more destructive agents, despite the ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BTWC) in 1975. The reasoning behind the increased production of more aggressive biological and chemical agents was to prevent a total Communist onslaught from the Soviet Union and Cuban-backed regimes, which threatened a complete takeover of Mozambique and Angola during the mid to late 1970's. It was believed that the Cuban troops deployed in those regions at the time had chemical weapons, which the South African government feared they would use.",154,630,320,305,1,17

In order to gain control of the region, the Russians sent masses of arms to the Angolans to use in their fight against white Afrikaners and the apartheid government. According to Anthony LoBaido, the Russians hoped to take control of South Africa's mineral treasures, which included diamonds, titanium and zirconium oxide.",154,970,318,215,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Much like South Africa's right-wing apartheid regime, the crimes committed by the ANC were vast and brutal. Many civilians and government officials were ruthlessly murdered in the name of liberation. ANC soldiers who refused to fight were physically and psychologically tortured and murdered in death camps located in Angola. The ANC's primary goal was to wage a campaign against the white-led regime that threatened to suppress them at any means.",154,1202,315,179,1,17

The incident, known as the Soweto uprising, led to the alleged further production and use of the CBW by the SADF. Moreover, between 1976 and 1979 a war in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) caused increasing political and racial tensions within South Africa.",154,1416,310,233,1,16

Botha called on the country's security forces to devise a more efficient method in which to deal with internal, as well as external conflicts.

His duties included the recruitment of approximately 200 medical and scientific researchers from around the world, management of annual funds of $10 million and the establishment and supervision of the program and related companies.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"In an effort to maintain secrecy, Basson created four front companies that served various purposes. Gould and Folb claim the front companies were created for three primary reasons: 1) to maintain secrecy by making it difficult to link the production of CBW facilities to the military, 2) to procure chemical and biological related substances, which normally would have been difficult for the military to obtain, 3) to discreetly channel funds from defense accounts to the research facilities. The four front companies were Delta G Scientific Company, Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), Protechnik and Infadel, which divided into two companies in 1989, D.
