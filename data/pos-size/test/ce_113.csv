There isn't a kind bone in FINGERS' body; it's a masterpiece of misanthropy that enrages as much as it dazzles. If you've never seen it, do so.

Watching him as he flits about his Manhattan loft bellowing the first movement of Vivaldi's GLORIA or banging out a flamboyant rendition of ""You Don't Know Me' at the piano while ineptly playing traffic cop in the two-car pileup that is his love life is to see a limitlessly talented actor redline it for ninety minutes.

Meanwhile, he's investigating the balance of power in male/female relationships, and how it's predicated by material wealth. Or something. To tell you the truth, I lost interest early on when Frederick Weller got into an exposition-crammed screaming match with some bimbo on Times Square.

Which is not to say that this go-for-broke sensibility results in any memorable set pieces; again, like Harlin, Richet may be able to pull of a single, well-composed shot (e.g. Gabriel Byrne's confrontation with Maria Bello), but his action choreography is pretty lackluster.
