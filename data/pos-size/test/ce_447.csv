Theory Two was a little more sinister: it must be a scientific experiment that the Americans are doing. Hmm, we said to each other, maybe it's time to go. Really, there wasn't any hostility.

Water poured through the ceiling fans and dripped steadily from dozens of bubbles on the ceilings. All my things--barely unpacked as I had moved in only recently--were dumped out into the living room. We knew they'd be working on the water pipes under the house--so why was all the water upstairs? This has to be a legendary screw-up! How the hell did they flood the upstairs by fixing the pipes downstairs? Our landlord, a CPP colonel, stood barefoot surveying the mess.

A big piece of the roof collapsed under the first really violent rainstorm of the year, and no, nobody is going to go up there with a tarp or anything, not until tomorrow.
