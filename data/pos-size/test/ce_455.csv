""From the very onset, Ty, Katie and myself have had that passion and goal, and that's definitely where Unity comes from. It's a musical search that with complete support from our parents, we've been able to pursue, and it's likewise for Paulie and Geoff. That came very much to the forefront just before we came in to record this album. It signifies that after all the success that Polyserena had, the basic formula was happiness in music, and that's where we come from and where we're going to and what Unity encapsulates.

It comes back to the Falling Inside thing - not wanting to let other people make you jaded. For me this is Special Ones Part II. It's very much about self empowerment and self worth, and empowering in the sense of everyone has so much stuff in their life that if you wanted to let it get you down it could, whatever it is. It's not just about being in the music industry, it's just whatever it is about your life.",279,9907,209,305,1,23

Everyone has some element in their life and this song will hopefully transcend to all sorts of different people - and it might be relevant to race issues or anything, and hopefully the positive aspect will come through.",279,10229,209,233,1,23

This is one of those songs that came together in the studio - we still weren't certain about where it was at by the end of pre-production - and then something happened when Dave (Nicholas, producer) started miking up the whole studio space and the four other members of george found a special groove.",279,10497,205,251,1,23

We left it to the very last song, and the whole time we were thinking it would probably be a closing track of the record. For Ty and I, that's our favourite backing vocal moment. It was inspired by keening, a particular vocal technique that's all in the throat, and it's actually a style of singing used in mourning. I'm wondering if people will think it's other people!",279,10765,210,269,1,23

I'd only written the parts for one guitar, but had ideas for an accompaniment. I put together a basic arrangement of three or four sections that went loosely together, gave a copy to Katie who added a vocal melody and then joined that with a poem from Martin Challice (who also writes a lot of lyrics for Elixir, Katie and Nick's other project).",279,11069,210,287,1,23
html body text div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div p span  ,"Katie: This was the first song that I wrote with Paulie B. He had this beautiful, revolving, languid, sensuous riff that the guys had recorded some music around instrumentally. I had a little walkman and I played it and sang along to the CD and it just happened. It's a very sensuous song and very thematic. It's also just about letting go emotionally and surrendering to everything. I ended up doing the lyrics at sunset, as the sun was setting on the deck. There were birds and everyone sitting around. The little birds were ***** around my head because I was near their nest and they were a little bit freaked out!",279,11373,207,377,1,23

Change started there for me. I got some chords together with him and worked on it as an acoustic piece. When I got it to george everyone said let's rip it apart and put it back together - as we always do! That's the wondrous thing with george. For me, this is one of the best expressions of the group. The guitar is not a feature, just part of the melee. It was one of my favourite tracks to record.",279,11963,211,323,1,23
