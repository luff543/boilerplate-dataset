I was shunned by my mom and siblings and was left to fend for myself. I dragged myself around for several weeks, starving, weak, and full of fleas and worms! Finally, a nice gentleman found me and called Delaware Valley Veterinary Hospital, who told him to call Shirl of Stubbs Animal Rescue, also a client of Del Val. I was examined by Dr. John Vinciguerra. He told my rescue mom that my leg had to be amputated! However, before I can be operated on, I must put on some weight and get stronger. Dr. Steve Milden and Dr. John Vinciguerra of Delaware Valley Veterinary Hospital will be doing my surgery. My rescue mom says they are the BEST and that they will take great care of me!",8,253,764,95,1,7
