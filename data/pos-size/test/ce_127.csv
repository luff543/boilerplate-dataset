This sentiment resonates with the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans and citizens around the world who are standing up to challenge the growing power of the giant media corporations.

This is a movement for everyone that likes a good story, that wants to tell one or hear one, whether theyâ€™re a veteran media-maker or someone whose only just thought of picking up a camera or imagined seeing their story in print.

So if a server was receiving the minimum wage whatever a server made between $7.35 and $11.03 every hour would go into the employers pocket. Thatâ€™s is basically a wage cut of $3.68 per hour, nearly $30 in an 8 hr. day, and nearly $150 a week. Thatâ€™s taking a living wage job and turning it into a poverty level job.",8,2211,763,107,1,6

html body text div div span  ,Having spoken with the Sierra Clubâ€™s Olympia lobbyist Friday I understand that some amendments have been made in the Senate version SB 5285 (house version is HB 1357) which would facilitate the privatization of municipal water provision in Washington.,8,2570,753,53,1,6

html body text div div span  ,"However I feel that the bill is still deeply flawed and should be scrapped altogether. The bill still halves from 60 to 30 days the requirement for public notice.

Itâ€™s not as if this planned assault doesnâ€™t affect anyone. More than 890,000 Washington state residents are current Social Security beneficiaries. Senator Murray, in particular, who easily won re-election, has no excuse for remaining silent. If you want to save Social Security as we know it, please contact our Senators and Representatives and tell them itâ€™s not enough to just tell their constituents they oppose the Presidentâ€™s plan for private accounts. Tell them, itâ€™s time to go public, to stand up and be counted.",48,12024,687,111,1,9
