html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Secondly a new opinion poll has suggested that public support for ID cards has started to slide dramatically from around 80% to 55%, just as Mr Kennedy has always claimed it would.",153,3192,411,47,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Now one poll may not signify anything, but it comes amid growing whispers that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is desperately seeking a way of averting a Commons defeat over the issue when it comes back before MPs in the next couple of weeks.",153,3253,408,63,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"And if that happens, as with Iraq, Mr Kennedy will claim he is the only party leader to have consistently opposed the policy.",153,3330,401,31,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Unfortunately for one colleague it didn't quite work like that.,153,3510,317,15,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,First he rang the MoD to ask about how to obtain information under the FOI rules.,153,3539,397,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The switchboard attempted to put him through to a number which did not work.,153,3584,415,15,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,So he was given another number to dial himself. That connected to one of those infernal disembodied voices which directed him to yet another number.,153,3613,415,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,When that was dialled he was greeted with the message that the number could not be recognised. At which point he gave up.,153,3658,406,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Only a temporary tickle on the freedom front I'm sure.,153,3703,282,15,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"A bit late in the day perhaps, but I have only just heard of a great wheeze deployed by ex-Tory election boss, Lynton Crosby, to keep morale high among the party's staff during the election campaign.",153,3761,411,47,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"He handed out daily prizes for all sorts of things other than simply good performance. For example, on one occasion the award was for the best mobile phone tone.",153,3822,406,47,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The budget for this scheme was quite low, however, so the prizes were modest, but imaginative, and were sometimes awarded for only a day.",153,3883,411,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The bottle of beer was, understandably, non returnable, but the booklet of the ""60 most appalling lefties"" had to be returned once read.",153,3928,401,31,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"This tradition is aimed partly at showing the new intake what a thoroughly friendly, trustworthy and sober bunch we all are.",153,4137,388,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,But it is hard not to get the impression that some of the MPs have come along simply to put a face to the names of those they expect to be their future tormentors - or at whose hands they believe they may have already suffered.,153,4182,404,47,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Still, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and, hopefully useful event.",153,4243,330,15,1,14

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,No great surprise there as there has been a continuing programme of gradually turning the Palace of Westminster into a smoke free zone.,153,4391,408,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,But what surprised and even angered some was the rule banning people from lighting up outdoors if they were in sight of members of the public.,153,4436,401,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Presumably the powers that be think it would not present the right image to tourists visiting the mother of parliaments to see little knots of people hanging around the precincts shrouded in clouds of smoke.,153,4481,407,47,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The rules state quite bluntly that any member of staff found puffing away in front of the public will be reported to their line manager. Persistent offenders will face disciplinary action.,153,4542,399,47,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,It is not clear whether these restrictions apply to MPs - they would never seek privileges ahead of members of staff would they?,153,4603,404,31,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,Still I would love to witness the first occasion one of the security staff attempts to stop an MP lighting up in full view of the public.,153,4648,411,31,1,14
