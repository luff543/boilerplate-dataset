html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,The call came in Scottish Renewables’ response to the latest consultation from Ofgem and the Department of Trade and Industry on setting a new set of transmission charges as part of the reform of electricity regulations (known as BETTA – the British Electricity Transmission and Trading Arrangements) due to come into force in April 2005.,45,336,516,89,1,24

According to Maf Smith, Development Manager for Scottish Renewables:",45,444,515,53,1,24
html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"“this is a key consultation for renewables, and industry needs to get Ofgem’s views on how the whole BETTA project will encourage and support renewables. The consultation was originally meant to be out in January 2003, but we keep seeing deadlines for release being moved. The consultation is now about 10 months late, and Ofgem can only draw so many lines in the sand before industry starts to ask ‘what have they got to hide?’.",45,516,515,107,1,24

html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Maf Smith notes, “we welcome the fact that Ofgem-DTI are looking at how to balance locational charging with the need to support renewables in peripheral areas like Scotland. However, their proposed model is unworkable, and will lead to regulatory uncertainty in the industry and could frustrate future development of renewables in Scotland. This is bizarre, given that one of the key aims of BETTA is supporting renewables in Scotland.”",45,696,525,107,1,24
html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Scottish Renewables points out that Ofgem-DTI are proposing to offer rebates on generation in areas of low population density and note in their consultation,45,822,521,35,1,24
html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"“We would see this definition [of peripherality] as wholly inappropriate to smooth running of an electricity system, as peripherality in electricity trading has almost nothing to do with population density, and is therefore a crude lever” says Smith.",45,876,520,71,1,24
html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Instead Scottish Renewables Forum are calling for Ofgem to set a capped charge that would allow charging to have a locational element but also ensure that peripheral conventional generation should not be penalised. Furthermore, renewables generation should be charged at a capped average Transmission use of system charge.",45,966,517,89,1,24
html body text mm:beginlock mm:endlock div table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Maf Smith notes: “This approach would be easier to regulate, is simpler and would ensure that development in Scotland is not stymied. Ofgem’s approach is to introduce a contradictory set of signals, which is akin to putting two sets of traffic lights at a road junction and expecting the traffic to continue flowing smoothly. We need clarity from Ofgem-DTI to ensure that we avoid crashes on the road to developing renewables in Scotland.”",45,1074,511,107,1,24
