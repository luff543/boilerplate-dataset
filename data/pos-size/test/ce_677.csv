html body text div div p span  ,"Think again. In the wild, more than 95 percent of higher plant species not only harbour fungi in their roots, they actually supply them with sugars and other foods. In return, the fungi furnish the plants with raw materials - water and nutrients from which food substances are synthesised - and protect them from soil-borne diseases. The relationship is therefore of benefit to both: a symbiosis.",8,1148,757,71,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"The close association of the roots of trees with certain fungi was described as long ago as 1885, by German forester AB Frank. The name for the association, mycorrhiza, literally means ‘fungus root’. It is only within the last 30 years, however, that scientists have begun to realise that far from being the exception, such relationships are actually the norm in the plant kingdom.",8,1236,765,71,1,7

html body text div div p span  ,"There are two main types of mycorrhizal fungi, associated with different plant species. On trees, the most common type is known as ectomycorrhizae or EM, as most of its structure is outside the root, often forming a visible sheath over its surface. Hyphae also grow inside the root between the cells, forming a characteristic structure known as a Hartig net, and most EM fungi also produce fruiting structures like mushrooms and puffballs.",8,1493,766,71,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"The other major type, endomycorrhizae, have most of their structure inside the root. Also known as arbuscular mycorrhizae or AM, these are more primitive fungi than the EM type, making up only 150 of the estimated 6,000 mycorrhizal fungi species. However, AM is the predominant type, found on 65 percent of plant families, including grasses, herbaceous plants and woody species, with most colonising a wide range of plants. The branches of the tree-like structures - the arbuscules - that AM fungi produce have a large surface area across which the plant and fungus can exchange substances to the benefit of both. This occurs inside the root but outside individual cell membranes.",8,1581,763,107,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"Their microscopic structure makes AM fungi difficult to see and they do not form above-ground fruiting bodies, but more than 90 percent of vascular plants are thought to associate regularly with them. They send out thin hyphae into the soil that actively mobilise nutrients (particularly insoluble phosphates that are often the limiting factor in plant growth) from dead organic material and the soil’s mineral fraction.",8,1705,767,71,1,7
html body text div div h4 span  ,Working with nature,8,1798,144,17,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"The early attempts of forestry researchers to inoculate young trees with mycorrhizal fungi of the EM type involved macerating and liquidising the root systems of ‘donor’ trees, and dipping seedling root systems into the slurry. Results were patchy, and such preparations had short shelf lives.",8,1837,755,53,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"In the 1980s, EM mycorrhizal fungi were finally cultured on a commercial scale without host roots, and induced to form spores.

html body text div div p span  ,"Since then, research has continued apace with more species cultured, including the more difficult AM species that are obligate symbionts (they only grow on host roots). Companies such as PlantWorks in Kent are now producing formulations increasingly tailored to different host species and soil conditions. Many of these now contain both AM and EM fungi, making them suitable for a wide range of plants. These are beginning to appear in garden centres, but how useful are they to home gardeners?",8,1995,768,89,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"The short answer is: it varies, depending on the site, conditions and plants grown. For plants on poor, disturbed or contaminated soils, mycorrhizal inoculation can be vital. On the Betteshanger Colliery shale deposits in Kent, a study by Christ Church College Canterbury and PlantWorks showed that inoculated birch seedlings had mortality rates of less than 3 percent, compared with 60 percent in untreated plants.",8,2101,767,71,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"Mycorrhizal fungi dislike disturbed ground and are not found in subsoil, so in areas such as gardens of new-build houses or recent landscaping they are often not present and may not appear naturally until too late for newly-planted seedlings. Simply digging over beds or hoeing in a garden can disrupt existing mycorrhizal relationships.",8,2189,745,53,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"A cycle of negative feedbacks is common in gardens: disturbance damages the fungal partners of plants, making them less able to absorb nutrients, so the gardener adds a chemical ‘fix’ of inorganic fertiliser, which is toxic to the fungi, making them even less able to supply the plant.",8,2259,754,53,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"In organically-managed gardens and areas cultivated for wildlife interest, in particular, it makes sense to encourage mycorrhizal growth with early inoculation, minimal digging and mulching with organic matter that the fungi can break down slowly and naturally rather than using chemical fertilisers. Plants in such regimes are much better equipped to resist stresses such as drought, disease and excess heat - all of which may become increasingly important as global warming seems set to accelerate.",8,2329,761,89,1,7

html body text div div p span  ,"Mycorrhizal fungi are most effective in fine, actively growing fibrous roots, so the initial problem is physically how to introduce the fungus to these parts of the plant. The simplest method, now well-established in forestry and landscaping, is to apply a solution containing the inoculant by dipping the roots in a liquid or gel formulation (pictured, right). This technique is only really suitable for dormant, bare-root woody plants.",8,2752,764,71,1,7
html body text div div p span  ,"For pot-grown plants, tablets or powdered formulations can be mixed into the growing medium. The nursery industry has been quite slow to take up this method, probably because plants grown in sterile media and supplied with all their water and nutrient needs may show little extra growth after inoculation.
