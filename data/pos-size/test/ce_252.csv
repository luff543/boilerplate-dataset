html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"The report, “Migrant Health”, found that amongst the 4,253 people that were diagnosed with HIV in 2004 and had their place of birth recorded, approximately 70% were from abroad. The most common country of origin was Zimbabwe, whose current dire economic crisis and appalling track record on basic human rights have led many to seek asylum in the UK. Zimbabwe has an adult HIV prevalence of 20% but the current economic conditions mean that access to antiretroviral treatment is severely limited. Often there is little choice but to move to somewhere where HIV treatment is available to avoid death.",8,2006,766,107,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"The report does however state that around a third of non-UK born residents receiving HIV diagnoses do so at least two years after their arrival in the United Kingdom, suggesting that fears of ‘health tourism’, (whereby migrants come to the UK specifically to receive treatment) are perhaps unfounded. In addition, around 92% of migrants receiving a positive HIV diagnosis will also receive a diagnosis of AIDS within three months, meaning they have probably delayed coming forward for HIV testing for a long time. Delaying testing and treatment can lead to a person developing a range of serious opportunistic infections, putting additional strain on emergency care services, and causing unnecessary suffering to both them and their families. The report recommends that the problems be addressed, and that greater efforts be made to make healthcare accessible to the migrant population.",8,2132,769,143,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"One barrier to achieving this goal however is the fact that migrants who are here illegally, or whose asylum applications have failed, have to pay for antiretroviral treatment on the National Health Service. Very few can afford the charges, so will instead avoid health care services altogether.",8,2294,768,53,1,12

html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"“HIV can be associated with stigma in many communities and … addressing stigma requires culturally appropriate approaches with the affected groups as well as education of the wider UK population,” the report states.",8,2420,736,35,1,12

html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"Such dire warnings are entirely unfounded. The vast majority of migrants with HIV come from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV prevalence is very high.

html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,A new national government-funded campaign on sexual health was launched on Saturday in an attempt to combat the exponential rise in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) being seen across the United Kingdom.,8,2968,751,35,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"The visual campaign, which incorporates television and print advertisements, depicts young people displaying the names STIs on their clothing in place of the usual designer logos. It then goes on to encourage young people to use a condom with the phrase “Condoms: essential wear.” The TV adverts will appear on Channel 4, Five and various digital channels, while print adverts will feature in popular young people’s magazines. Radio adverts that have been produced in a similar style will also discuss the physical effects of STIs.",8,3022,767,89,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"The campaign is aimed at 18-24 year olds, the group judged most likely to transmit and become infected with STIs, and is designed to complement a number of more low-key web-based programmes (such as the ‘R U Thinking?’ campaign) aimed at younger teens.",8,3130,767,53,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"It is twenty years since the government ran the last major TV campaign on sexual health, which featured the famous slogan “AIDS: Don’t Die Of Ignorance” engraved on a tombstone. The advert, and an accompanying leaflet that was delivered to every home, had a considerable impact on the rates of transmission of all sexually transmitted infections. Fear of AIDS dramatically reduced the number of people having unprotected sex, an effect that lasted until the mid-1990s. As people’s memories of the campaign faded however, so HIV and other STI infections began to rise. Today, many doctors are warning that common STI infections, such as chlamydia and herpes, are at near-epidemic proportions, with more serious illness, such as HIV and syphilis also spreading rapidly.",8,3202,768,125,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"""Some STIs like chlamydia are on the increase amongst 18 to 24 year-olds and it is vital that we deliver strong messages about using condoms to prevent them,” said the Public Health Minister, Caroline Flint at the launch of the campaign.",8,3346,742,53,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"“The aim of this campaign is to make carrying and using a condom among this age group as familiar as carrying a mobile phone, lipstick or putting on a seat-belt. This is not about encouraging promiscuity, but saying to those who are already sexually active: sex without a condom is seriously risky, so always use one.”",8,3418,759,53,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"While most sexual health groups have welcomed the long-overdue campaign, there are those who have said it does not go far enough. The original budget for the programme announced back in 2003 was £50 million. The current campaign has cost just £4 million, leaving a potential £46 million still to be spent.",8,3490,760,53,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"Caroline Flint has said that the £50 million total is meant to be spent over three years. It is however three years since the campaign was first announced, and there have been no promises made that the rest of the allotted cash will be used at any point in the future.",8,3562,759,53,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"Perhaps one reason why the campaign has been restricted in its scope is the fact that Britain’s sexual health services are simply not in a fit state to accept the huge influx of extra patients that are likely to seek screening as a result of more widespread advertisements. £300 million was promised to improve and modernise Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) services back in 2003, but because the cash was not specifically earmarked for sexual health, many National Health Service Primary Care Trusts have used the money to dig themselves out of debt instead. Most GUM clinics therefore remain understaffed and overstretched, with patients lucky to be seen in two weeks rather than the two days recommended by the Department of Health.",8,3634,764,125,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"Another reason for the restriction may be that fact that the government is squeamish about discussing sexual health on television before the 9 o’clock watershed, when younger viewers may be watching. Aiming the campaign at 18 – 24 year olds overcomes this problem. However, while some STIs, such as chlamydia, are statistically most common in this age group, STIs do also affect younger (and older) people in significant numbers, and there is a danger that using very age-specific campaigns could lead other groups to believe they are not at risk.",8,3778,756,89,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"A survey released this week for example has shown that many teens are having sex for the first time before the legal age of sixteen, with girls twice as likely as boys to lose their virginity before this age. While the government does have some online and print campaigns aimed at younger teenagers, these are very low key, and their reach and impact has never been officially assessed. Encouraging condom use may well be inappropriate for younger teens, but there is currently little in the way of support for those who wish to wait until they are older to have sex, and indeed many may not recognise it as an option. Sex and relationships education remains non-compulsory in schools outside the scope of basic science lessons.",8,3886,765,125,1,12
html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"With 95,000 people receiving diagnoses of Chlamydia last year, and 58,000 people now living with HIV in the UK, sexual health has to be made a far bigger priority. The tombstone advertisements of the 1980s may have been overly-dramatic by today’s standards, but the fact that they were targeted at everyone in the country meant that AIDS became an issue of national importance that few people were ignorant of. The campaign changed cultural norms, and made sex without a condom simply unacceptable. The current adverts are a welcome first step towards a return to this way of thinking, but it seems unlikely they will have any true or lasting affect unless the campaign is sustained and broadened out to a wider audience.",8,4030,764,125,1,12

html body text div div div table tbody tr td p span  ,"The fact that reckless HIV transmission is now potentially a criminal matter, means that the police are assuming they have the right to fully investigate anyone they suspect of having passed on HIV, sometimes on the most tenuous of hear-say evidence. The original complaint against Miss Porter was filed by a man with whom she had recently split up. This man was HIV negative, but his account lead police to search Miss Porter's flat for evidence of previous partners, an investigation which eventually led them to a 31-year old DJ, who was HIV+ and willing to take his former girlfriend to court. Such investigations represent a gross invasion of privacy, and paint a worrying picture of a police force that is wasting many man hours actively tracking down and encouraging former partners to make a complaint. Such activity may be portrayed as justified in cases such as Miss Porter's, where a conviction was ultimately obtained, but it is believed that in many instances, police will raid homes and seize medical records of entirely innocent people, purely on the basis of a complaint from a former lover seeking revenge.",8,10564,761,179,1,12

A prison sentence is also unlikely to help the guilty party (or indeed the victim) come to terms with their HIV status or change their behaviour, nor is it going to act as a deterrent to others – the law rarely features as a point of consideration in the bedroom, as is evident from the huge numbers of young people that have sex under age. We therefore believe that if criminal prosecutions are to take place at all, psychological counselling to help end their denial about their status would be a far more useful outcome, and better still, HIV campaigns and education should be made far more prominent to help people protect themselves from infection in the first place.",8,10762,762,143,1,12
