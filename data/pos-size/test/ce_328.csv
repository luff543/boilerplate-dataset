html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,AN INTRODUCTION TO SATURATED VAPOUR PRESSURE,164,19,416,55,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"This page looks at how the equilibrium between a liquid (or a solid) and its vapour leads to the idea of a saturated vapour pressure. It also looks at how saturated vapour pressure varies with temperature, and the relationship between saturated vapour pressure and boiling point.",164,99,457,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,The origin of saturated vapour pressure,164,207,341,20,1,12

html body text center table tbody tr td font p i span  ,average,196,280,62,17,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"energy of the particles in a liquid is governed by the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the average energy. But within that average, some particles have energies higher than the average, and others have energies lower than the average.",164,280,433,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,Some of the more energetic particles on the surface of the liquid can be moving fast enough to escape from the attractive forces holding the liquid together. They evaporate.,164,386,454,53,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,The diagram shows a small region of a liquid near its surface.,164,456,435,17,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Notice that evaporation only takes place on the surface of the liquid. That's quite different from boiling which happens when there is enough energy to disrupt the attractive forces throughout the liquid. That's why, if you look at boiling water, you see bubbles of gas being formed all the way through the liquid.",164,626,455,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"If you look at water which is just evaporating in the sun, you don't see any bubbles. Water molecules are simply breaking away from the surface layer.",164,732,426,53,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Eventually, the water will all evaporate in this way. The energy which is lost as the particles evaporate is replaced from the surroundings. As the molecules in the water jostle with each other, new molecules will gain enough energy to escape from the surface.",164,802,438,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,The evaporation of a liquid in a closed container,164,908,367,17,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Now imagine what happens if the liquid is in a closed container. Common sense tells you that water in a sealed bottle doesn't seem to evaporate - or at least, it doesn't disappear over time.",164,942,448,53,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,But there,164,1012,69,17,1,11

html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,constant evaporation from the surface. Particles continue to break away from the surface of the liquid - but this time they are trapped in the space above the liquid.,164,1012,437,53,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"As the gaseous particles bounce around, some of them will hit the surface of the liquid again, and be trapped there. There will rapidly be an equilibrium set up in which the number of particles leaving the surface is exactly balanced by the number rejoining it.",164,1334,451,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"In this equilibrium, there will be a fixed number of the gaseous particles in the space above the liquid.",164,1690,438,35,1,11

html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,Measuring the saturated vapour pressure,164,1830,315,17,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,It isn't difficult to show the existence of this saturated vapour pressure (and to measure it) using a simple piece of apparatus.,164,1864,448,35,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font b span  ,Note:,270,1927,37,15,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font span  ,"This experiment is much easier to talk about than do, given the safety problems in handling mercury because of its poisonous vapour. This is particularly going to be a problem if you want to find the saturated vapour pressure of a liquid at a higher temperature. You would have to use a more complex bit of apparatus. That isn't a problem you need to worry about for UK A level purposes.",270,1927,352,105,1,10
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"If you have a mercury barometer tube in a trough of mercury, at 1 atmosphere pressure the column will be 760 mm tall. 1 atmosphere is sometimes quoted as 760 mmHg (""millimetres of mercury"").",164,2080,449,71,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"If you squirt a few drops of liquid into the tube, it will rise to form a thin layer floating on top of the mercury. Some of the liquid will evaporate and you will get the equilibrium we've just been talking about - provided there is still some liquid on top of the mercury. It is only an equilibrium if both liquid and vapour are present.",164,2467,452,107,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The saturated vapour pressure of the liquid will force the mercury level down a bit. You can measure the drop - and this gives a value for the saturated vapour pressure of the liquid at this temperature. In this case, the mercury has been forced down by a distance of 760 - 630 mm. The saturated vapour pressure of this liquid at the temperature of the experiment is 130 mmHg.",164,2890,438,125,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,You could convert this into proper SI units (pascals) if you wanted to. 760 mmHg is equivalent to 101325 Pa.,164,3032,407,35,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"A value of 130 mmHg is quite a high vapour pressure if we are talking about room temperature. Water's saturated vapour pressure is about 20 mmHg at this temperature. A high vapour pressure means that the liquid must be volatile - molecules escape from its surface relatively easily, and aren't very good at sticking back on again either.",164,3084,449,107,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,That will result in larger numbers of them in the gas state once equilibrium is reached.,164,3208,441,35,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,The liquid in the example must have significantly weaker intermolecular forces than water.,164,3260,399,35,1,11

html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,The effect of temperature on the equilibrium between liquid and vapour,164,3374,451,35,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,You can look at this in two ways.,164,3426,230,17,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"There is a common sense way. If you increase the temperature, you are increasing the average energy of the particles present. That means that more of them are likely to have enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid. That will tend to increase the saturated vapour pressure.",164,3460,451,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,Or you can look at it in terms of Le Chatelier's Principle - which works just as well in this kind of physical situation as it does in the more familiar chemical examples.,164,3566,444,53,1,11

html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,The forward change (liquid to vapour) is endothermic. It needs heat to convert the liquid into the vapour.,164,3879,440,35,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"According to Le Chatelier, increasing the temperature of a system in a dynamic equilibrium favours the endothermic change. That means that increasing the temperature increases the amount of vapour present, and so increases the saturated vapour pressure.",164,3931,444,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,The effect of temperature on the saturated vapour pressure of water,164,4037,451,35,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,The graph shows how the saturated vapour pressure (svp) of water varies from 0°C to 100 °C. The pressure scale (the vertical one) is measured in kilopascals (kPa). 1 atmosphere pressure is 101.325 kPa.,164,4089,457,71,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p b span  ,Saturated vapour pressure and boiling point,164,4469,337,17,1,12
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"A liquid boils when its saturated vapour pressure becomes equal to the external pressure on the liquid. When that happens, it enables bubbles of vapour to form throughout the liquid - those are the bubbles you see when a liquid boils.",164,4503,456,71,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"If the external pressure is higher than the saturated vapour pressure, these bubbles are prevented from forming, and you just get evaporation at the surface of the liquid.",164,4591,434,53,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"If the liquid is in an open container and exposed to normal atmospheric pressure, the liquid boils when its saturated vapour pressure becomes equal to 1 atmosphere (or 101325 Pa or 101.325 kPa or 760 mmHg). This happens with water when the temperature reaches 100°C.",164,4661,452,89,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"But at different pressures, water will boil at different temperatures. For example, at the top of Mount Everest the pressure is so low that water will boil at about 70°C. Depressions from the Atlantic can easily lower the atmospheric pressure in the UK enough so that water will boil at 99°C - even lower with very deep depressions.",164,4767,449,107,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Whenever we just talk about ""the boiling point"" of a liquid, we always assume that it is being measured at exactly 1 atmosphere pressure. In practice, of course, that is rarely exactly true.",164,4891,431,71,1,11

html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,rather than evaporation. Sublimation is the direct change from solid to vapour (or vice versa) without going through the liquid stage.,164,5090,438,53,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"In most cases, at ordinary temperatures, the saturated vapour pressures of solids range from low to very, very, very low. The forces of attraction in many solids are too high to allow much loss of particles from the surface.",164,5160,438,71,1,11
html body text center table tbody tr td font p span  ,"However, there are some which do easily form vapours. For example, naphthalene (used in old-fashioned ""moth balls"" to deter clothes moths) has quite a strong smell.
