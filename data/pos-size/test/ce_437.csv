html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"There was considerable disagreement on that point in the wake of the high court ruling, which continues the court's recent trend of viewing student religious activities as a form of protected free expression rather than as an establishment of religion. Using the language of free-speech cases, the court said the school district engaged in unconstitutional ""viewpoint discrimination"" when it barred the Good News Club from meeting after school in an elementary school cafeteria. The meetings were aimed at exposing children age six through 12 to Christian Bible teachings.",185,419,580,125,1,18

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"""President Bush's proposal is not to single out the religious groups for favoritism, but to include them as additional options or resources addressing everything from job training to mental health counseling to substance abuse treatment,"" said Kmiec.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"""Financial aid cases and speech cases are still viewed differently by the court,"" Laycock said.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The most immediate effect of the decision will be felt at public schools, which may have a harder time arguing that a group's meetings are ""too religious"" to be held on school premises.",185,929,579,53,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,The ruling appears to erase a line that several appeals courts had drawn between permissible clubs that discuss social issues from a religious perspective and organizations that can be barred because they are too much like worship services or are aimed at converting students.,185,999,573,71,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"""We disagree that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development,"" wrote Justice Clarence Thomas for the majority.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"School officials say the ruling will make it difficult for them to prohibit the use of school facilities for any kind of religious purpose — including Sabbath worship services, which are already permitted in many districts, especially in the South.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Souter also said, ""It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion."" Thomas's majority opinion said Souter's description of the club's activities was accurate. Joining Souter's dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.",185,1685,579,107,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"The ruling also appeared to break new ground in the court's analysis of the perceptions of elementary school children. Traditionally, in speech as well as religion cases, the court has said that the younger the audience, the more impressionable it is — and therefore, the easier it is for government to restrict the message the children are receiving.",185,1809,578,71,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"In the case decided yesterday, Milford officials had argued that elementary-age children would gain the impression that the state was endorsing religion if they saw the club convening at school, even after classes are over.",185,1897,562,53,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"But Justice Thomas's majority opinion dismissed that argument.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"As for the perceptions of the children themselves, Thomas said, ""We cannot say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded from the public forum.""",185,2037,579,71,1,18

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font p span  ,"Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agreed.
