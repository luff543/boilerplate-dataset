Never mind that, no matter what the plan, the Bush Campaign would ridicule any element that it could not coopt. (That led to the recent pecularity, following Kerry's first clear speech on an Iraq plan, in which the unreflective Bush Campaign declared through parallel statements to the media, ""His ideas are the same as ours"" and ""He's advocating 'defeat and retreat'"".)

html body text div div span  ,"The questions are not entirely unfair, but Ignatius again ignores the fact that what might work today might not work tomorrow, let alone next month. The answer to ""can we win this thing"" seemed a bit different when Bush was strutting beneath his ""Mission Accomplished"" banner than it does today - and the colossal mistakes made since that time make it much less likely that we will achieve the results we most desire. Then, ""winning"" was defined as creating a stable nation with a secular, democratic government. Today, ""winning"" seems to be defined as achieving stability, preventing civil war, and creating a government that is not hostile to western interests. Would Ignatius call a plan to achieve that end a plan for victory?",8,889,764,125,1,6
html body text div div span  ,"Bush, the person in the best position to provide the type of answers Ignatius demands, won't provide them. His answers would be an admission of the failure of his central promises in the ""liberation"" of Iraq, and would also reveal that he has no ""exit strategy"".

html body text div div span  ,"Bush would love for Kerry to paint a strategic picture on Iraq that addresses the present realities. ""See how negative and pessimistic he is. Defeat and retreat.

And Bush knows that had he clearly enunciated his plan for Iraq and ""exit strategy"", he would have had to update the plan so frequently as to be (in his parlance) the quintessential flip-flopper, or would have had to repeatedly admit failure. Or both.",8,1123,769,107,1,6

The jury is then asked to pick a side by a ""preponderance of the evidence"" - which is why I referenced the coin toss.
