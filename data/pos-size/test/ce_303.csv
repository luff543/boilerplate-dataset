html body text table tbody tr td blockquote p font font span  ,When I worked in a floral department (for a few years) I used to get asked what type of flower was my favorite over and over and over again. I'd always try to change the subject when I could tell the guy was single. Hehe. Finally I'd have to tell them because some guys are smarter than others. So I might as well spill the beans here. I am not a rose person. I think they are pretty but when it comes down to it if I do get one single rose it seems more valuable to me than having a dozen. Two seems more like a connection with you and the person you love. I used to get one single rose from a guy I dated last year. It seemed so much more thoughtful than a bouquet. I got so much more excited than I would with more than one. I wonder why? He normally gave them to me when I wasn't expecting it... but they were also never red... he'd give me yellow or pink. When I would see red roses from men before it just didn't hit the heart. I think that sounds odd because every woman loves a rose. So down to my favorites... I absolutely love Lilies. There are different types that are gorgeous but even the regular hybrid colored ones just shine in brilliance. Then last but not least are the silver roses. Those have a hint of a blue lavender look but the smell can just melt a girl.,327,951,626,180,1,12
