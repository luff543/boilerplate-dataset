html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"There are some disadvantages in being the one who is divorced. Firstly, you can be ordered to pay the legal fees for the divorce; this may seem (and often is) extremely unfair, a case of adding injury to insult. This is based on the old principle in the courts that if you prove your case then you get your costs, despite the fact that it is not always appropriate in the family justice system. However, if the practicalities of the actual divorce are agreed by both parties, it is also possible to agree that the two of you will share the legal fees between you, or indeed that the person who actually files the petition will not seek an order for costs against the spouse.",241,386,407,150,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Secondly, you may have the unpleasantness of being on the receiving end of some legal description of your private life, especially if the divorce is based on unreasonable behaviour. It is possible to file an Answer to the allegations and try to regain control of the process by forcing a compromise on the allegations made, but most prefer to avoid the legal complications and significant expense of doing so. Nevertheless, allegations made as to unreasonable behaviour do often stick in the gullet as the contents of the Petition rarely have much to do with why the marriage broke down.",241,552,410,135,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"But who petitions against whom rarely spills over in to other more important areas, such as the children or finance. It is worth just checking that none of the allegations in the Petition relate to dealing with the children or to financial issues, since once the divorce is granted, those allegations become a finding of fact. Unless it is specifically agreed beforehand, these findings can be referred to in linked proceedings.",241,703,399,105,1,18
html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"The usual way of preventing such difficulties - and much acrimony too - is to offer the Petition in draft before it is sent to the court. Any items that cause particular upset can be discussed and either watered down or left out. This is not something that everyone has to do, but is very much in the spirit of the SFLA Code of Practice.",241,824,411,75,1,18

html body text div center table tbody tr td table tbody tr td blockquote p small font span  ,"Recent cases concerning 'big money' - where the assets available for division clearly exceed the parties' needs - have focused on the concept of equality of outcome. This may or may not mean that the assets are divided 50/50 in these cases. What it does mean is that contributions to the running of the home and the bringing up of children are valued equally by the court on divorce to contributions made by economically rewarding work. There may be other considerations - for example, the liquidity of the assets making up the family pot, or any inheritances received, or particularly bad financial conduct on one side, which dictate that the outcome should not be equal. Fairness is the key - and a 50/50 split will not be fair in all cases.",241,2419,408,180,1,18
