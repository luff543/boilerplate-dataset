html body text table tbody tr td div h2 font span  ,Reparations for the stolen generations - Government responds,221,265,455,55,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div h3 font span  ,"Speech delivered by the Honorable Philip Ruddock, MP. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs",221,341,494,43,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div font span  ,Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.,221,419,228,15,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"May I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land, the Gadigal (Gad -e- gal) people, of the Eora (Ee-or-a) nation",221,450,538,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,I understand very well that the subject of this Conference raises again the hurt and trauma of the past and that this is difficult for all of us.,221,496,533,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,I do know that there are many different views about these issues and I know that what I am about to say will not be appealing to all.,221,542,522,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Having said that, I thank the organisers for the opportunity to put to you an honest explanation of the government's position on these important matters.",221,588,540,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Let me also say that I think you have set yourselves an exceedingly ambitious task in seeking to develop a model for reparations and, in particular, individual financial compensation.",221,634,537,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The past practices of child separation represent one of the most comprehensively and roundly criticised chapters in Australia's history, regardless of how well intentioned our predecessors (our parents and grandparents and their parents) might have been.",221,680,540,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The effects are still felt by a significant number of removed Aboriginal children, their families and their communities.",221,725,526,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,The 1999 Parliamentary Motion of Reconciliation provided a very genuine expression of deep and sincere regret felt by most Australians.,221,771,536,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font b span  ,The Bringing Them Home Report,221,817,204,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,I know that we are not here today to discuss all of the recommendations of the,221,848,453,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font i span  ,Bringing Them Home,221,848,538,30,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,report. The question of reparations represents only a subset of those recommendations,259,863,502,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"And, as you know, the idea of individual monetary compensation is itself only one aspect of the reparations agenda proposed in the report.",221,894,544,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Other forms of reparations included acknowledgment and apology, guarantees against repetition, measures of restitution and measures of rehabilitation.",221,940,496,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,In its response to the report the federal government embraced many of these proposals.,221,986,506,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The national oral history project and the Parliamentary motion of regret are nothing if not an acknowledgment of and warning against repetition; the records access, parenting, family reunion and tracing services are obvious forms of restitution and, together with the network of counsellors, they also constitute a program of rehabilitation for those affected.",221,1017,536,60,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"In these and other ways the federal government has already accepted the principle of reparation as proposed by HREOC, of trying to make good the damage that has been done.",221,1093,528,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,Some commentators are comparing our approach to that of other countries. May I replace some fallacies with fact.,221,1139,516,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,The South African government has still not accepted the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations for a scheme of individual financial compensation,221,1185,474,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"nor has the Canadian government adopted proposals for such a scheme (although like us, it has funded family reunion, counselling and other healing programs) and nobody in New Zealand has ever received individual financial compensation as a result of the Waitangi Tribunal process.",221,1215,529,60,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font b span  ,Commonwealth Response,221,1291,163,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"We have said, clearly and consistently, that appropriate and practical steps should be taken to address the hurt and trauma experienced by the separated children and their families. In doing so we have focused in particular on family reunion, the issue identified in Bringing Them Home as ""the most significant and urgent needs of separated families"".",221,1322,543,60,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,And just a few months ago the Commonwealth reaffirmed this commitment by extending funding for the Link Up and related initiatives to bring the Commonwealth's total contribution to $117 million.,221,1398,542,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font b span  ,Compensation and a Tribunal,221,1459,182,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The Commonwealth (and the States) did not, however, accept the recommendations concerning individual monetary compensation and a national compensation tribunal: first, monetary compensation to individuals is not seen as the most appropriate way of dealing with family separation; second, given the varied and largely undocumented circumstances of the individual historical events in question, it would be impossible to devise and apply any such scheme in a practical and equitable manner; and",221,1474,538,90,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"third, an alternative tribunal process does not avoid the trauma of revisiting past events, nor does it by keep matters out of the hands of the legal profession and the courts.",221,1549,543,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,Today I want to focus on the feasibility of devising a practical and equitable scheme.,221,1610,482,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,The first and most fundamental question you need to consider is that of who you would and who you would not compensate.,221,1641,524,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"For example, would financial compensation be available to those children and families who are subject to contemporary separation practices or only to those separated in the past?",221,1687,544,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"And if you are talking only about the past, what would be your cut-off point?",221,1733,433,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Would you restrict financial compensation only to the children themselves or would you extend it to their families, descendants and communities (as recommended by HREOC)?",221,1764,542,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"If you decide that the children, families and communities of the separated children would not be eligible for compensation from the tribunal, then you are faced with the prospect of much of the existing litigation continuing in the courts.",221,1810,541,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"But even if you do decide to grant them eligibility for compensation, that raises another set of questions: how do you define which family and community members are eligible?",221,1871,533,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Do you take a culturally appropriate broad definition of ""family"" and ""community""?",221,1917,466,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,One of the most basic questions that a statutory compensation scheme would have to address is that of defining and deciding the circumstances that warrant compensation.,221,1948,543,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,You would need to distinguish those cases where adoption or separation was voluntary or involuntary but warranted from those where separation was both involuntary and unwarranted the mere fact of childhood separation does not of itself justify compensation.,221,1994,538,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"It has been said that a statutory scheme would be much simpler and therefore less costly than a normal judicial process. However, a large proportion of the costs of any such assessment in these cases is the difficulty of researching and reliably reconstructing events so long after they actually took place.",221,2054,541,60,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,This is very different from reconstructing the circumstances of a recent crime as in a Victims Compensation Tribunal. It is also very different from the Canadian situation where at least everyone knows who was and who was not enrolled in their residential schools.,221,2130,527,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"As your conference papers themselves acknowledge ""�questions about the validity of individual acts of removal � are enormously complex and variable.."".",221,2191,497,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Locating relevant documents and witnesses so long after the event would confront both the claimants and the respondents before a tribunal, just the same as if they were before a court.",221,2237,534,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"There are another series of questions: how would you apportion the onus of proof, and what would be the burden of proof, that is, to whom would you give the benefit of the doubt?",221,2283,528,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"And this would also involve making a trade-off between the rigour of the decision-making process and the eventual costs of any compensation scheme, the less rigorous the process, the greater the ultimate costs of compensation,",221,2329,529,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"but the more rigorous the process, the closer you get to the equivalent of a full-scale judicial hearing.",221,2359,532,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,A further question you need to consider is what avenues and grounds of appeal should be allowable from decisions of a compensation tribunal.,221,2405,516,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Then there is the question of who would be responsible for paying the compensation, and what would be the limits (if any) on the quantum of compensation.",221,2451,545,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,The answer to this question - combined with the questions of how many children were actually removed and how many of their family and community members would be compensated - will directly impact on the overall cost of any such scheme.,221,2497,541,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"In its submission to the Senate Inquiry, for example, the Commonwealth estimated the total potential cost of compensation as some $3.9 billion.",221,2558,523,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"If people wish to argue that pursuit of such claims through the courts is too costly, then they must also seriously examine the potential cost of any alternative scheme",221,2604,524,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The administrative costs alone would be prohibitive if a tribunal were also to have an investigative role and ""a full time presence at the local level"" [as is being recommended in your conference papers].",221,2650,543,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Whatever the quantum of individual compensation, there is also the related question of who would pay?",221,2711,525,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,One option being proposed is a national compensation fund to which all governments and churches would contribute.,221,2757,515,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"In the first instance the States and churches would have to agree on their relative contributions to such a fund; and they would also have to agree, in effect, to a blank cheque, in case the initial fund proved inadequate; and, in view of that possibility, they would almost certainly require severe strictures to be imposed on the design and operation of any compensation tribunal.",221,2803,543,75,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,It would be more realistic and more appropriate for the States and the churches to be directly liable to compensate the children whom they removed.,221,2894,533,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,What I have described today are the sorts of questions that the Commonwealth encountered when it examined the idea.,221,2940,531,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The alternative of pursuing compensation through the courts is not without its problem, as we all know.",221,2986,535,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"But a tribunal process would not necessarily do away with the trauma of revisiting, recounting and reliving past events",221,3032,535,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"And if it were to have any credibility, a tribunal mechanism would still entail the complex and costly process of reconstructing and verifying distant events. Nor would it see an end to the litigation, since no one has proposed that common law alternatives (or appeals) would be ruled out.",221,3078,544,60,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,It is the government's view that any additional resources that might be used for compensation should be channelled towards family reunion and related services.,221,3154,537,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,And we are not alone in that view. Not one State government has committed itself to providing financial compensation.,221,3200,539,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Federal Labor is the same. Indeed, the previous Federal Labor Government initiated the defence of the Kruger and Bray constitutional challenge to the NT Aboriginals Ordinance that was at the centre of the Cubillo and Gunner case.",221,3246,532,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,The NSW Labor Government defended the Williams case.,221,3307,335,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"Premier Carr said, ""I think we've got to move beyond the idea that we can do it by making a cash payment to compensate for things that happened in our past"".",221,3338,524,30,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"And most recently the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Minister have stopped talking about a ""compensation tribunal"" (as they did until a few months ago) and are now only promising a ""national conference"" to discuss ""alternative means of resolving these matters"".",221,3384,541,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font b span  ,The Way Forward,221,3460,108,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"The real question is how can we best redress the effects of past policies and practices? This is a question not just for the Commonwealth, but for State and Territory governments, the churches and the community as a whole.",221,3491,543,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,I believe that the government's $117 million response to the,221,3536,346,15,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font i span  ,Bringing Them Home,567,3536,127,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,report is a substantial demonstration of our commitment to assist those that have been affected by past practices.,221,3536,531,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td div p font span  ,"We do need to move forward and, as a community, we need to make sure that we do all we can to address the severe disadvantage that is faced by so many Indigenous Australians today.",221,3597,525,45,1,11
