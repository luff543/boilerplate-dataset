html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Last September, public safety officials in Wilson, N.C., confronted a nightmarish scenario: The police department's SWAT team arrested a man suspected of building explosive devices in his home. After his capture, the suspect told officers he'd planted a bomb in the house that was ready to explode.",191,364,342,107,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Facing a hazard of unknown proportions, police officers called Wilson Fire/Rescue Services, which moved quickly to protect citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. ""We pulled up our GIS system on a terminal in one of our trucks.We pinpointed the house on the map, and it gave us an evacuation zone,"" said Chief Don Oliver, of Wilson Fire/Rescue Services. ""We could identify the houses we needed to evacuate by address, so we got everybody out.""",181,502,366,233,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"With citizens out of harm's way, police used a robotic device to remove the bomb from the house and disarm it in the street.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"The incident offers a dramatic example of how Wilson Fire/Rescue uses mobile GIS technology to safeguard residents of this 50,000-member community in eastern North Carolina.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"The fire department tapped into the city's existing GIS system for information on streets, water lines and hydrants, electrical and gas lines, and building and zoning specifications.",181,1124,348,71,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"A GIS fire analysis application allowed the department to add specialized information such as incident reports and fire inspection records into its system. GIS data generated by the system is loaded into computer terminals that are mounted in Wilson's firefighting vehicles. In addition, HP notebooks and handhelds help deliver GIS maps wherever they are needed. ""We run about 4,000 calls a year,"" Oliver said.""What we're doing is taking technology and applying it to decision-making in the emergency-service field.""",181,1214,368,179,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Launched in 2000, the initiative provides new technology tools to address the firefighting needs of a changing city. Once one of the world's largest tobacco markets, Wilson's economy gradually is shifting from agriculture to manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. ""We have three and a half million square feet of warehouse space that is used for storing everything from rubber to pesticides,"" Oliver said.",181,1412,369,143,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,Wilson uses GIS technology to give them the answers.,181,1574,349,17,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,One byproduct of Wilson's changing economic base is a large number of vacant commercial buildings which Oliver cites as the city's largest firefighting hazard. Firefighters attacking a blaze in one of these buildings confront a series of questions: Is the building locked up? Can they be relatively certain that no one is inside? Is the building structurally sound? Could potentially hazardous materials still be stored inside?,181,1610,367,143,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"The department identified every vacant commercial structure in the city, rated its condition and plotted the data on a GIS map. Buildings were put into one of four color-coded categories based on their potential danger. Categories ranged from green for structurally sound and secure, to red for abandoned and dangerous the latter being judged too hazardous to enter under any circumstances.",181,1772,359,143,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"GIS maps showing the shape, size, location and condition of vacant buildings were loaded into computer terminals mounted in the department's fire trucks.""So now, when the fire captain crawls into his rig, he enters the address and brings up a picture of the building,"" said Oliver. ""That tells him straight up whether he's going to be able to make an offensive or defensive attack on the fire.""",181,1934,370,125,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Geospatial information helps Wilson Fire/Rescue improve firefighter and citizen safety in other ways, too. Like any fire department,Wilson strives to make the best use of limited personnel and assets. GIS technology gave fire officials bold new insight into how and where to deploy resources.",181,2078,366,107,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"""You know the old adage, 'A picture is worth a thousand words?' Well, it's true,"" said Oliver. ""If I can show you a problem, rather than tell you about the problem, you'll understand it a lot quicker.""",181,2204,360,71,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"For example, the department moved one of its two light squad companies across town after GIS information showed the squad was stationed in the wrong place. ""One of the primary responsibilities for these companies is to respond first to emergency medical calls, saving wear and tear on our larger trucks,"" Oliver said.""We had them in what we thought was the most centrally located stations in the city. But we found out that one of our engine companies was responding to over 600 EMS calls a year, and one squad had only responded to 143.""",181,2294,368,179,1,16
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Since its relocation, the squads cover the majority of EMS calls in the city.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"For example, analysis of the department's emergency medical calls pinpointed locations where traffic accidents occurred frequently.

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"""Where we're really making a difference is being able to convey information taking data and creating pictures that show how we can mitigate issues before they become major problems,"" Oliver said.",181,2852,366,71,1,16

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td span  ,"Oliver expects GIS maps to help the department strengthen its fire safety education programs too. Although the city's economy is changing,Wilson still has a large population of migrant agricultural workers, many of whom cannot speak English.
