The meedingwas attended not only by the Mahomedans of Lucknow, but by gentlemen whohad come from all parts of Upper India to be present at the Mahomedan EducationalCongress. It represented the intellect and the aristocracy, the brain andthe muscle, of the Mahomedan community. There were present the taluqdarsof Oudh, members of the Government Services, the Army, the Professionsof Law, the Press and the Priesthood; Syeds, Shaikhs, Moghals and Pathansbelonging to some of the noblest families in India; and representativesof every school of thought, from orthodox Sunni and Shiah Maulvis to theyoung men trained in Indian colleges or in England. The Syed's speech lastedan hour and a half, and was delivered with great eloquence. It was receivedwith enthusiastic applause. The chair was occupied by Munshi Imtiaz Ali,the [[2]] legal adviser of the Oudh Taluqdars' Association, a distinguishedpleader belonging to an ancient and noble Arab family of Oudh. The speechwas delivered in Urdu, taken down by Munshi Aziz-ud-din, and afterwardsrevised by Sir Syed himself. The substance of the lecture was as follows:--",48,251,682,269,1,6

My attention has always beendirected towards the education of my brother Mahomedans, for from educationI anticipate much benefit for my people, for Hindustan, and for the Government.But at the present time circumstances have arisen which make it necessaryfor me, I think, to tell my brother Musalmans clearly what my opinionsare. The object, gentlemen, of this lecture is to explain the attitudewhich the Mahomedan community ought to adopt with regard to the politicalmovements of the time. I am not going to give a philosophical discourse,nor to speak of those abstract questions on political economy which wouldrequire many lectures fully to deal with; but I am simply going to expressmy opinions in a plain and straightforward manner, leaving it to everyonewho hears me to agree with me or differ from me. The reason why I standhere to address you today is because there has grown up in India a politicalagitation, and it is necessary to determine what action should be takenby the Mahomedan community with regard to it. Although my own thoughtsand desires are towards my own community, [[3]] yet I shall discuss whetheror not this agitation is useful for the country and for the other nationswho live in it. If it be useful, we must follow it; but if dangerous forthe country or our nation, we must hold aloof.",8,562,767,235,1,5

If the Government fight Afghanistan or conquerBurma, it is no business of ours to criticise its policy.

A Select Committee was then appointed, which read throughthese memorials and discussed them at length, many of which on considerationturned out to be thorough nonsense. Extracts from Urdu papers were alsoconsidered. Although not in my presence, yet often amendments suggestedby these memorials have been adopted. This is the method of our Government.After this the law is passed and sent to the Secretary of State, who isassisted by the Council of State, which consists of men of the highestability, who have lived for a long time in India and have often held alloffices, from that of Assistant Collector to Lieutenant-Governor. If theythink it expedient it is passed, otherwise a short note of four lines cancelsit. Often people make objections to the laws so passed, and in some casesthey are perhaps right; but in the majority of cases, as far as my experiencegoes, those very people who sit in their houses and make objections would,if they had been on the Viceroy's Council, have supported them. Many detailsappear wrong on superficial consideration, but when all the circumstancesand difficulties [[6]] are taken into account, they are seen to be right.In conclusion, whether the laws be good or bad, no one can say that Governmentacts independently of the wishes and opinions of its subjects.

When the Government of India passed outof the hands of the East India Company into those of the Queen, a law waspassed saying that all subjects of Her Majesty, whether white or black,European or Indian, should be equally eligible for appointments. This wasconfirmed by the Queen's Proclamation. We have to see whether, in the rulesmade for admission to civil appointments, any exception has been made tothis or not; whether we have been excluded from any appointments for whichwe are fitted. Nobody can point out a case in which for any appointmenta distinction of race has been made. It is true that for the CovenantedCivil Service a special set of rules has been made; namely, that candidateshave to pass a competitive examination in England. Perhaps it will occurto everyone that this examination ought not to be held in England, andthe proposal about which the greatest agitation has taken place is thatit should be.held in India.

This is nodifficult question of political economy. Everyone can understand that thefirst condition for the introduction of competitive examination into acountry is that all people in that country, from the highest to thc lowest,should belong to one nation. In such a country no particular difficultiesare likely to arise. The second case is that of a country in which thereare two nationalities which have become so united as to be practicallyone nation. England and Scotland are a case in point. In the past manywars were waged between those countries, and many acts of bravery weredone on both sides; but those times have gone, and they are now like onenation. But this is not the case with our country, which is peopled withdifferent nations. Consider the Hindus alone. The Hindus of our Province,the Bengalis of the East, and the Mahrattas of the Deccan, do not formone nation. If in your opinion the peoples of India do form one nation,then no doubt competitive examination may be introduced; but if this benot so, then competitive examination is not suited to the country. Thethird case is that of a country in which there are different nationalitieswhich are on an equal footing as regards the competition, whether theytake advantage of it or not. Now, I ask you, have Mahomedans attained tosuch a position as regards higher English education, which is necessaryfor higher appointments, as to put them [[11]] on a level with Hindus ornot?
