Thoughts of Tarpeia and Xanthe clouded my mind, however, so I decided to stay up. I went through my daily ""waking up routine"" very slowly. I was ready to go one hour later. It was still quite early, so I walked around the castle, as I used to do with Xanthe often. She seemed increasingly bitter as time went on, until yesterday. Still, it was only a slight improvement, and who knows what her ends were. After maybe half of an hour's worth of wandering, I reached the long and winding staircase leading to the roof, which I decided to climb up, not having much else to do. The view was nice at the top. I sat on a parapet and watched the sun rise. The dawn was tranquil; most people were not up by then. The bright sun crept up the horizon and into the sky; it's rays cascading off a hill and into the castle. It was a beautiful sight; one he wished I could share with someone. However, I still sat up there alone.",8,6214,761,161,1,7
