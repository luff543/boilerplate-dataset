html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div table tbody tr td p span  ,"""He was a sizable investment. We took a lot of time and spent a lot of money. There's two things you look at in a dog, ability and temperament. A lot of times it's a trade off. You either get a great dog that's technically proficient in his skills or you get one with a great temperament. We spent the money to get both. He's very gentle. Little kids come up to him and grab him in the face and he's just fine with it. He enjoys the attention, but when he gets the command, he's all business.""",207,339,497,125,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div table tbody tr td p span  ,"Dex Von Der Pulschnitzquelle, is a full-blood German shepherd who was actually born in Germany. In fact, his commands are still in German. The dog arrived in the United States for training at Rudy Dexler's School for Dogs in Elkhart, Ind. in October and he's been on the job since December. When he's not being petted and pampered by hotel guests and employees, the canine is hard at work learning the ropes in a new high-rise home where even riding an escalator can be a challenge.",207,481,497,125,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div table tbody tr td p span  ,"Dex doesn't go it alone though. Stratosphere security guard Steve Lieberman, a guard who has been with the property since it opened in 1996, was selected to be the dog's constant companion.",207,623,495,53,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div table tbody tr td p span  ,"""I had a German shepherd up until my early 20s. I really didn't want another dog at that point. I just didn't feel I'd get one as good as Silver. But when I heard that they were going to have a trained dog, I knew that would be something I'd like to do,"" he said.",207,693,488,71,1,18
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div table tbody tr td p span  ,Lieberman beat out more than a dozen other hopefuls to get the job. Then he spent almost a month in Indiana training with Dex at the school for dogs.,207,781,490,35,1,18

That includes everything from patrolling the casino and parking garages all the way to the executive offices and the tower shop mall here, along with the tower and the base of the tower,"" Davidson said. ""With the addition of Dex, we have what we feel is one of the most significant security forces in the city which is very appropriate not only with the events of Sept. 11 but for everything that occurs here at this property.""",207,885,498,143,1,18

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td div table tbody tr td p span  ,Dex already has his own security badge (worn by Lieberman who said the dog's better looking) and his own business cards.,207,1221,475,35,1,18
