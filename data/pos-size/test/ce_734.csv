Robert Browncreated Asclepiadaceae in 1810 to accommodate a group of Apocinaceae plantswhose characteristics did not fit well into that family. He named the newfamily Asclepiadaceae and included in it all those former Apocinaceae plantshaving their pollen contained in gelatinous masses called pollinia(singular is pollinium). The only other group of plants with pollinia arethe Orchids. Asclepiadaceae includes the common roadside milkweeds(Asclepias), the popular succulent Stapeliads, which look more like cactithan Asclepiads and the very interesting Dischidias, whose leaves are oftenshaped like pouches and urns and serve as homes for ants. Hoya contains themost beautiful flowers in the family.",11,614,595,161,1,9

The sides are so divided that there isa movement afoot to instigate formal efforts to have the name Hoyaconserved since it is the most widely known name. If Vahl's manuscript hadbeen published when it was first submitted there is no doubt that Hoyaswould be known as Sperlingias today. Sperlingia lost out due to itsauthor's having been hanged for treason.

One Atlanta grower lost most of his hoyas last winterbecause the roots got too dry. My Hoya roots were given even less water thanhis and mine thrived. We compared notes and concluded that the onlydifference between our growing conditions was that the humidity in mygreenhouse was near the saturation level. Humidity provides summerprotection too. I have seen Hoya leaves burn nearly to a crisp in summer,even with exhaust fans running full time and daily watering - and with a50% shade cloth covering the roof. I do not use exhaust fans in mygreenhouse because I find that mealie bugs are sucked in with the breeze. Ihave lots of circulating fans inside and maintain humidity near thesaturation point.

These are easily controlled by systemic insecticides,unless you are opposed to their use. Many control them with plain oldrubbing alcohol. Many spray it on the plants right from the bottle. Othersdilute it with water and add soap or sticker spreaders to it. Some say youshould wash the alcohol off after it has done its job, but it isn'tnecessary. It does no harm as long as the sun doesn't hit the plants while theyare still wet - it is no different than plain water in that respect. Someuse insecticidal soaps. I have found the use of alcohol andinsecticidal soaps to be worthless, except that alcohol applied to a swab,used to wipe the insects off does a pretty good job but this is extremelyimpractical in a large collection and could become a full time job. Othersuse preying insects. We in Atlanta learned the hard way a few years agothat preying insects, which are not native to the area can create moreproblems than they solve. Once they feed on the mealy bugs, they startlooking for other food and that food may not be what you'd like them to feedon. Also when removed from their natural homes they must find other nestingplaces to their liking. Ten million non-native Lady Beetles crawling allover one's ceilings, floors, furniture and inhabiting one's bread box willcure one of importing exotic preying insects very quickly. If one has onlya few plants, swabbing with alcohol is the ideal method of ridding onesplants of insect pests. In a greenhouse with several thousand plants,chemical control is the only practical solution. If you can afford to hireprofessional handlers to apply the chemicals, I strongly advise it. If youdo it yourself, be sure that you follow the directions on the containerprecisely and wear protective clothing. The best method of pest control isstill to avoid them in the first place. Keeping all new plants isolated forabout six weeks before introducing them into your pest free collection isthe best advise you will ever follow.",11,3535,600,413,1,9
