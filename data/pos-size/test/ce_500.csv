html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Roger J. Traynor served as a justice on the California Supreme Court from 1940 to 1970. During that time he gained a reputation as one of the nation's most innovative and influential judges. He wrote the first state supreme court decision overturning an antimiscegenation statute, he reformed family law and the doctrines governing divorce, he restructured the rules for police searches, and he caused the Court to adopt a strict liability standard in product liability cases. Using Traynor's opinions, primary and secondary sources related to those cases, Traynor's writings on the theory of judging, and oral history, this book examines Traynor's work and his influence.",226,446,474,215,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Traynor's judicial philosophy stands out in the intellectual history of judging as an extreme. Few if any theorists of judicial decision making have so resolutely advocated innovation. However, unlike other activist judges of his era, Traynor often handled contentious issues with a minimum of controversy. Though his philosophy of judging was extreme, in practice, his style was so persuasive that most of his innovative decisions became institutionalized in American law.",226,678,472,125,1,21
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Like the contemporary U.S. Supreme Court's ""constitutional revolution,"" which expanded government regulatory power over the economy and created a new civil liberties jurisprudence, Traynor's innovative opinions committed the law to the equitable treatment of individuals with relatively little power. However, Traynor's success at gaining institutional acceptance for his judicial innovations depended in part on his sensitivity to the arguments against activism. His rationalist style set apart his brand of activism and gave it a tone of objectivity. Despite the controversy surrounding judicial activism, his adroit articulation of the public interest in legal reform made his opinions widely influential.",226,820,475,179,1,21
