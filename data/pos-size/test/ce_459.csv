html body text div div div div p span  ,"On 11 September 2001, General Tommy Franks was enroute to Pakistan to meet with President Musharraf to discuss a number of issues, among them security cooperation and terrorism. The events of that day caused him to return immediately to Tampa, Florida, where his staff was already working along with Defense and other government agencies to ensure what is referred to in the military as ""command and control survivability"" while continuing to develop ""situational awareness.""",8,1797,769,89,1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"On 12 September the Secretary of Defense directed the preparation of ""credible military options"" to respond to international terrorism. For Central Command, that directive guided the preparation of the plan that unfolded in Afghanistan.

This ""mission analysis"" resulted in Franks' recommendation of a military course of action which was approved by Secretary Rumsfeld on 1 October. Franks briefed the concept to President Bush on 2 October, and Bush directed that combat operations should begin on 7 October -- 26 days after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon.",8,2009,721,89,1,9

html body text div div div div p span  ,"With the cooperation and support of this coalition and the integration of virtually every agency of the US government, CENTCOM had executed multiple ""Lines of Operation,"" attacking simultaneously on several fronts. The intention from the outset was to seize the initiative and reinforce success, while keeping in mind the lessons of previous campaigns in Afghanistan -- avoid ""invading,"" and work with (rather than against) the people. A critical enabler of the strategy was the coordination of basing, staging, and over-flight rights. This political-military coordination set (and maintained) the conditions necessary to execute and support sustained combat.",8,2185,768,107,1,9
html body text div div div div p span  ,"Among the lines of operation which characterized the campaign had been ""Direct Attack of the Leadership of Al Qaida and the Taliban,"" and the provision of ""Humanitarian Aid"" to the Afghan people.

Twenty days later, the provincial capital of Mazar-e Sharif fell. In rapid succession, Herat, Kabul, and Jalalabad followed. By mid- December, US Marines had secured Qandahar Airport and the Taliban capital was in the hands of Anti-Taliban forces.

html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"Combining the resources and capabilities of the Defense Department, Central Intelligence Agency, and other agencies of the Federal government has produced results no single entity could have achieved.

html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"This operation continues to be commanded and controlled from Tampa, Florida with fielded technology providing real-time connectivity to air, ground, naval, and Special Operations Forces operating 7000 miles away. CENTCOM forces were deployed from 267 bases; are operating from 30 locations in 15 nations; and currently over-fly 46 nations in the course of operations. Yet, the ability to ""see"" the battlefield literally and figuratively at each location provides unprecedented situational awareness.",48,3453,723,89,1,10
html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"Security cooperation, diplomacy, and military-to-military contacts have built relationships that have proven invaluable during the campaign. Humanitarian airdrops; economic and security assistance to coalition partners and regional allies; visits to the region by senior Administration, Congressional, and military officials; and a US commitment to post-conflict reconstruction of Afghanistan have permitted the US to build upon these essential relationships. The investment in security cooperation has been repaid tenfold in access to basing, staging, and over-flight rights with regional partners.",48,3543,716,107,1,10
html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"Precision guided munitions are more than a force multiplier. They have reduced the numbers of air sorties required to destroy targets and have resulted in unprecedented low levels of collateral damage. From this perspective, use of precision guided munitions has produced a positive strategic effect.",48,3651,677,53,1,10
html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"As has been said in the past, the availability of strategic airlift is critical to the success of operations that require force projection. The current airlift fleet requires strict management and innovative scheduling and the experience in ENDURING FREEDOM would seem to validate the testimony the committee received last year -- that the US must expand its strategic lift capabilities.",48,3705,729,71,1,10
html body text div div div div ul li span  ,The importance of combined and joint operations training and readiness has been revalidated. The power of a well-trained air- ground team has permitted the combination of 19th Century Cavalry and 21st Century precision guided munitions into an effective fighting force.,48,3777,722,53,1,10
html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"A continuous, unimpeded flow of intelligence remains key to success on the battlefield. Human intelligence is essential when mission objectives include locating, identifying, and capturing or killing mobile targets. This requires people on the ground.

html body text div div div div ul li span  ,"Information Operations also have been vital to the success of ENDURING FREEDOM.
