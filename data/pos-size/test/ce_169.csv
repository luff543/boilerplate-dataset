I alsogreet you in the name of the people of Tonj County. It was really a concern ofour people yesterday that our people did not see me welcoming our guests to thismeeting house. People were saying that, as a commissioner of this place, I wouldsay a word of welcome to the delegates in general. Let me proceed, because itwould have been good for me to welcome yesterday so that the Commander and theGovernor were also to hear what the Commissioner of TC was saying. But sincethat could not happen, let me proceed with a brief speech, even though that isnot equal to the speech I had prepared yesterday.",8,1726,763,95,1,6
html body text font p span  ,"When we come to the purpose for which we have gathered, we were informed lastSeptember that there would be a Nuer Dinka meeting in Tonj County. Preparationswere made then, but somewhere in the middle we began to doubt that the meetingmight not be a success. Why were we doubting? We were doubting because, in thecourse of preparations, there were things that were supposed to be done. But wefound that little or nothing had been done as far as some services hadproceeded. Communication was not prompt from Nairobi to our end. We werereceiving communication at some points, but at others we were lost in the line.There were times when we had difficulty knowing who was to do what, who was toprepare what. But in time we found that Mr. Mario Muor Muor and Tular Deng hadbeen given certain responsibilities. I came to this place to speak with thechiefs asking that they get on with the work of construction as quickly aspossible. Building got underway, as did the digging of a well. However, it isunfortunate that we have only one well, which results in the congestion which wehave experienced. So later on when we saw Mr. Mario running back and forth, wewere struck by words like those of Shakespeare, which said: ?? We knew that wewould have to redouble our efforts. Buildings would have to be built quickly.Like these buildings were build quickly in a way that is inadequate to themodern way of preparation. This is why we have many of us sitting on the ground.So much for that, let us proceed.",8,1835,766,175,1,6
html body text font p span  ,"Here, let us come to the very matter for which we have gathered. It is goodto say that we are here to record a very important event in Tonj county inparticular. This is a rare opportunity, hardly to be equalled in our history.The Nuer and the Dinka are one people given their social and culturalbackgrounds. But in the course of time we have been divided by the enemies ofthe people to fight ourselves. However, it is okay because all of us are awarethat sons quarrel with their father, and daughters with their mothers, but therecomes a time when a family sits together to resolve their differences.Yesterday, who could not see the white bull outside here? The bull that was veryfierce, that was almost on the neck of everyone who passed? That bull was notbrought by accident, but it was brought by design, and that was a design forpeace. So, with the words of the spearmasters over this bull yesterday, Ithought that the entire effort was finished, and that we had come here simplyfor formalities. If we did understand the words of the spearmasters talkingoutside over the bull, and even inside here, I don't think we have much more tosay. It has been done. We have only to reflect on the wise resolutions which wecan make to bring the words spoken to their fulfilment.",8,2024,769,143,1,6

Dr. Peter Nyot is here fromGermany, and Michael Wal has come from the US, both have come from afar to joinwith us. This shows us that this is a serious matter since those from far awayare joining with us here. As well, our foreign press people show that this is aworld-wide concern, since organisations from far away have sent theirrepresentatives. We have even asked ourselves concerning some people, how theyhave come, if they were invited by the churches or other people. I'm seeingbrother Samuel Aru with a very serious delegation from Khartoum, so I have askedmyself if Omer Bashir is interested in peace.

One of the things they said was that this would be aconference of the people, in which local people would take the lead, and itwould not include poliltical leaders. They may be present as observers but notas participants. They said that all of the people must be mobilised toparticipate in this conference, that NSCC should prepare the Conference, andthat observers from around the world must be invited to attend.

html body text font p span  ,"Now I would like to tell you a short story from the Bible, that sets thestage for the Dinka to tell their story before the Nuer, and for the Nuer totell their story before the Dinka. This is a story that I told in Loki for thechiefs and leaders in Loki, and that was the beginning of three days in whichthey told their stories, each group to the other. As you know, today is Sunday,which is the first day of the week. It was on a Sunday, after Jesus had died onthe cross and been raised from the dead, that this story took place. Most of thedisciples were together in a special room, but one was missing. His name wasThomas. And suddenly Jesus appeared in the room, and his message was, ""Peace bewith you."" The disciples were excited to see him, but when they told Thomas, hewould not believe it. He said, unless I see him, and put my fingers in his sidewhere the spear went in, I will not believe it. One week later, again on aSunday, Jesus appeared in the room and Thomas was present. Jesus said to Thomas,""Reach out your fingers and feel the wound where the spear went in.""",8,4537,763,127,1,6
html body text font p span  ,"This is a conference about reconciliation. Thomas could not be reconcileduntil he could see the wounds that he had helped to cause, and touch the placeswhere Jesus had been wounded. For seven and a half years now, Nuer have causedwounds and injuries to the Dinka, and for seven and a half years now, Dinka havecaused wounds and injuries to the Nuer. If you want to be reconciled you musttell each other the wounds you have suffered, you must look at each other, andreach out and touch one another in the places where you have been wounded. Itwill be important that you speak the truth, that you not hide anything fromanother, so that the reconciliation goes deep, and it is a genuine healing ofthe wounds you have inflicted. When you speak the truth, when you say the hardthings to each other, when you identify the issues that must be solved, then youcan reconcile relationships, and you can walk out of here, saying now we arebrothers and sisters once again. In just a few minutes, you as the Dinka, willbegin to tell the Nuer your stories. Do not hold back. Tell the true stories, nomatter how painful it may be. In just a few minutes, when the Dinka tell theirstories, you Nuer, you must listen carefully. Do not debate with them, do notargue with them. Relationships begin with listening. And when they have finishedyou will tell your stories to them. The time of beautiful speeches is over. Itis now time for the hard work of peace. You must make a peace that will last.When I sit down, this will be your work. You, Nuer and Dinka, must make thispeace and determine how deep the peace will go.

The talktoday and onwards is for you the chiefs to talk, not me. However, after you haveconcluded your statements, I will speak. Peace and reconciliation beganyesterday when a white bull was sacrificed, and libations were poured. We hadalready raised the house of peace, but what remains is the plastering of thewalls and floor and roofing of the building of peace. However, this is not easywork that is before us. If we plaster the house wrongly it is likely thatinsects will still bight us. If we don't put up good poles it is likely that thehouse will leak. I will start with what Bill Lowrey has said, that we must drawfrom the experience of our ancestors. We do each stage of the work so that it issuccessful, and it is a solid house. During our meeting we will begin with thechiefs who attended the meeting in Loki, and we will move ahead so that arepresentative from each county has opportunity to speak.

html body text font p span  ,"I will not speak at length. I have been a chief fora long time, in the area of Mapeer in Rumbek. By ethnic group I am Agar from BeGRegion. Some months ago I attended the meeting in Loki for the purpose ofreconciliation between Dinka and Nuer. When I returned from Loki I disseminatedthe content of the Accord among Dinka and Nuer. Recently, I also participated inthe exchange visits of the Chiefs, stopping at Leer, and here. Yesterday webegan our reconciliation by offering a white bull, and we said all that neededto be said, and the bull is now in its eternal existence above. It has alwaysbeen our traditional practice that, when we have conflicts, as we often do, wemake sacrifice and we are able to reconcile and return to our normal life.Usually we conclude by confirming an accord between ourselves and Nuer with anaccord that states we will no longer raid one another so there is no more lossof property or life. At the end of every conference we come out withdeclarations which are sent to Leer, Mapeer, Tonj, and elsewhere, confirmingthat we should no longer fight each other. And the present reconciliation, beingassisted by the churches, means that we address the issues that divide us andbring conflict and we put an end to them. Sometimes back we had a conference inGainlel, and we sacrificed bulls and that concluded our conflicts between Dinkaand Nuer. As well, we had a conference at Wuniloor, and that meeting ended ourproblems until the conflicts of Anyanya I brought out new conflicts betweenDinka and Nuer. The border conflicts intensified again with the tension betweenSPLA and Nuer, giving thieves concerned with their own well-being opportunity toexploit our differences. As well, our differences have been exploited by ourenemies. D&N are brothers, who share common borders. With our sacrificeyesterday our hostility was brought to an end. There are people who are againstthis peace agreement, who have benefited from our hostility. There will be somewho will come trying to persuade our peoples on each side to believe that theother will not be faithful to our agreement, but we must not listen to thesedeceptive words. We have always been fighting each other, D&N, but has neverbefore happened that we deserted lands such as Mapeer. Today it is other peoplewho have come in to exacerbate these conflicts. An example is that our ancestralhome of Rumbek was in the hand in the enemy. Now that we have captured it fromthe enemy we have made alterations and we are able to occupy our own landscomfortably. As I said, in respect to Rumbek, I can now return to my ancestralhome of Mapeer and we can settle there once again. Normally, in the relationshipbetween us and Nuer, what keeps conflicts from being concluded, is when variouspretexts are brought up, saying we must locate the thief, and find the detailsof the case. All of these are delaying tactics, which should not deter us frompeaceful coexistence. Yesterday we sealed our covenant. It is not in Dinkatradition that we should begin accusing one another, or quarrelling with oneanother, after sacrifice is offered. We should not be doing this here. Ourgathering here is heard all over the world, in Khartoum and Juba, and many otherplaces. Thus, in my view, there is no use in talking about past grievances. Whatwe need to focus on is concrete actions to be taken to bring peacefulco-existence between our peoples. From this day forward we must stop the killingof women and children, and destruction of our properties. We reconcile ourselvesfrom Yirol, Rumbek and Bentiu. I will not proceed further with my address. Thisis the message I'm telling the people of Gogrial and Tuic, that ourreconciliation was concluded yesterday with the offering of our white bull.

When those who went toBongo split apart, it was unfortunate that we accepted that separation. I neverthought there was a government in Leer, until I saw the Commissioner of Leer. Ihave no bad commissioner from Leer. When we said earlier that we should savelives, I also accept fully what you said, because I have a border with ChiefMalual Wun.

Malual is now the only one remaining chief with sons ofthe chiefs who once were his counterparts. We are all children, of this onefather who remains, Malual Wun. If there is a complicated problem, and yourfather is still alive, he would be the one who restrains the children from selfdestruction. The wisdom of CMW and our wisdom is not the same. He began workingsince the time of the British with our fathers. Most of us began working duringthe time of independence with the Arabs. We have always thought that CMW of thesaying in Dinka. A lion said to a father to give him his children so he couldeat them. Today all our fathers are gone except CMW. The lion ate all theelderly people, but one old person was hidden by his children. The lion that atethe elderly people happened to swallow a snake with water. The snake would comefrom his stomach, peaking out from his mouth. On person suggested that he bringand old man to take the snake from the stomach of the lion, wouldn't the lioneat the old man? The lion accepted the old man to be brought.

We Dinka we are willing toaccept reconciliation with all our hearts, but we have some doubt about ourbrothers Nuer. You, Nuer, when we have something good, you change it intosomething bad the following day. The reason I say this, is that we went to Bongobecause we have a problem. The Arab claims this land. When we went to Bongo itwas because of that problem with the Arabs, but then we began to quarrel amongourselves. We have killed ourselves in greater numbers than our original enemyever killed us.

The problems that occurred at Bilpham did not begin there, but theyoriginated right here prior to their departure. In 1984 a group of young menfrom Gogrial and Tonj began departing for Bilpham. As they went they naturallyhad to pass through Nuerland. As they reached Abuong they were intercepted. Manywere killed and others were drowned while some returned. This had nothing to dowith the leadership. In the spirit of reconciliation we must begin with thegenesis of the problem. It is not with the leadership. We would like to know thechief who was responsible for the killing of our young men as they were en routeto Bilpham. It is important to begin with the genesis of the problem. That iswhy I asked for the senior military commander. That route through Abuong becameunsafe for our the passage of our people and we were forced to move any partiesthrough Bor area as our only alternative route. I challenge you, asking someoneto come and tell me that this is not the real state of affairs, as I havedescribed it. The route through Bor was a far longer route for our people. Whenwe decide to reconcile and become one, I must tell you that, currently, we nowhave two of our people with you in Nuer. They have now devastated Gograil, . . .and Tuic areas. When you prepared to come, did you first really speak with themto ask what they intend to do. If we are sincere about reconciliation I addressmyself to those from Nuer area. You have with us Carbino Kwanyiny Bol and Matip.Does it really make sense for us to reconcile if they are not with us, becausethese two people are with you now. If we reconcile without their participation Ibelieve our efforts will be incomplete. s we are all Southerners, we have lostour women and children, cattle and properties. I am glad to here that theCommissioner from Bentiu is here with us. As you saw yesterday, we haveresponsible people with us here from our side.

As you have seen yesterday, we don't have an army. YesterdayGovernor Nhial Deng Nhial and Commander Selva Kiir were here to guard anyagreement we come to in this place. What about you? Who will ensure that ouragreement stands firm in your areas? When Chief Majok came here . . . Tell me,if we go to your area will we find that our Dinka are still alive there? As Isaid before, the Nuer are here with their property, they are here with theircattle and their children. If you want to take them with you are welcome to takethem. But I would only ask that you reciprocate, allowing our Dinka people toreturn to us also. I conclude with greetings, and emphasise before theorganisers, that this peace and reconciliation will be monitored, so that theDinka can go to Nuerland and claim their properties and likewise the Nuer cancome to Dinkaland to receive what belongs from them.",8,7421,768,351,1,6
