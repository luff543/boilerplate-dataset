html body text p span  ,"The history of the text of Beowulf is almost as dramatic as the adventure it narrates. The earliest manuscript (perhaps) belongs to the 11th century. After the dissolution of the monasteries, it came into the possession of Laurence Nowell. It was acquired in the 17th century by Robert Cotton, who donated it to the state in 1700. The manuscript survived fire in 1731, before being moved to the British Museum on its foundation in 1753. The charred and disintegrating remains of the manuscript were studied by the Danish scholar, G.J. Thorkelin, whose library was wrecked and papers destroyed by the Royal Navy in 1807 during the siege of Copenhagen. Collations in 1817 and 1824 demonstrate the manuscript's rapid decay before finally being conserved in 1845. It was among the first texts published as a photographic facscimile (Zupitza",8,911,765,143,1,5
html body text p a span  ,1882,66,1037,36,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,"), among the earliest manuscripts analysed under ultra-violet light (Smith",102,1037,473,17,1,5
html body text p a span  ,1938,575,1037,36,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,) and has recently been subjected to innovative fibre-optic study (Kiernan,8,1037,750,35,1,5
html body text p a span  ,1984,331,1055,36,17,1,6

html body text p span  ,An ultra-violet close up of the space between two letters showing that a third letter was erased by the clerk who prepared the manuscript. An intuitive navigation tool highlights numerous similar examples of damaged or erased letters that have been identified by scholars working on the manuscript.,8,1107,728,53,1,5

html body text p span  ,"is not one but several Beowulfs. The prize in some respects is the 11th century manuscript bound into the Cotton Vitellius A XV Codex, and including the other manuscripts that were bound with it, such as the Soliloquies of Saint Augustine and a fragment of the Anglo-Saxon poem Judith, which deserve more in the way of commentary than they receive. The high-resolution images are supplemented by close-up back-lit and ultra-violet images that show letters now lost to the naked eye, either because of corrections made in antiquity, or obscured during conservation. These images are presented as 'hot spots' on the text and are navigated effectively and cleanly, with a clever tool allowing the user a simple view of the manuscript or an interactive view that highlights parts of the text that have been lost or found. All this is supported by a hypertext dictionary for those of us whose Old English isn't what it ought to be, and a series of articles describing the project and the methods used to capture the text.",8,1177,759,161,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The eleventh century manuscript can be compared to later transcriptions, including two transcriptions prepared by GJ Thorkelin at the end of the eighteenth century. These show how the medieval manuscript has decayed, and allow scholars to develop a critically informed reconstruction of the parts of the manuscript now lost.",8,1373,752,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Accompanying this complete set of high-resolution images are equally high-resolution images of four early transcriptions of the poem. Finally, there is a fifth, modern, transcription and edition that highlight the multiple and at times conflicting nature of the text. The four early transcriptions reveal the extent of decay in the manuscript. Thorkelin's two transcriptions of the 1780s contain some 900 letters that had decayed or become invisible by the time Conybeare saw the manuscript in 1817. Only seven years later, Madden's transcription shows that repeated handling of the fragile and rapidly disintegrating text had resulted in the loss of some 1,900 letters - principally from the edges of the singed manuscript. This set of transcriptions demonstrate wonderfully why Thorkelin's edition may be more useful for an historical understanding than the medieval manuscript, since this has deteriorated very badly since Thorkelin's study was published.",8,1443,761,161,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Electronic Beowulf brings together many different versions of the text, including the Cotton Vitellius codex and all the important early transcriptions, as well as a modern transcription and edition. Navigation allows these different versions to be displayed simultaneously in a variety of forms.",8,1639,762,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Thus,",8,1709,40,17,1,5
html body text p i span  ,Electronic Beowulf,48,1709,126,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,"is in fact six different Beowulfs. These various texts are from many different locations. Thorkelin's transcriptions are now in the Royal Library of Denmark, while the Madden version is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Only the Cotton Vitellius A xv manuscript and now the Conybeare transcriptions are located in the British Library, the latter only being acquired in 1994. Never before have all these texts been available in one country, let alone in one place. Now, not only can they be studied together, but they have been brought together in an environment that makes comparison a simple matter and which incorporates the results of sophisticated analytical techniques. The effort to achieve this has been phenomenal, but the result is truly staggering. Beowulf scholars and students of Old English now have unimaginable riches at their fingertips.",8,1709,763,143,1,5
html body text p span  ,"I only wish I were such a scholar. There is a sense that while all these Beowulfs might be considerably more available, they remain as inaccessible as ever. For example, it seems truly remarkable that a volume so carefully designed, with several versions of the text and a dictionary, should be supplied without a simple translation of the text. It would not only be helpful for the interested amateur (or the list of cross-disciplinary scholars described in the introductory blurb accompanying the CD), but it could indeed support an interesting exercise in its own right. Comparing the text(s) to translation would demonstrate the necessity to return to source texts for an informed historical interpretation. Regrettably,",8,1869,758,125,1,5
html body text p i span  ,Electronic Beowulf,90,1977,126,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,"is only for those students of Anglo-Saxon culture already thoroughly steeped in the written language, not for historians or archaeologists who want to expand their knowledge. It is certainly not going to enthrall or enlighten the public, let alone make them better citizens.",8,1977,752,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"As well as a complete set of high resolution images of the medieval manuscript, Electronic Beowulf includes a complete modern transcription and edition so that students of Old English can improve their palaeography skills, by comparing the clean modern edition to the script of the manuscript. Search facilities based on the modern edition further enhance the high resolutions images.",8,2065,742,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"By the same token, the specifications of the computing equipment necessary to read the texts seem excessive for a product aimed at such a wide audience. The cover notes recommend a Pentium 133 with 32mb RAM and Netscape 4.5 and a Java plug-in. The software comes bundled with the product, but suffice to say that neither my own (borrowed) laptop nor (inherited) home computer could make any sense of it, while even my relatively high specification office system struggled at times. While there are undoubtedly some very large files involved, it is hard to see why such a high threshold is necessary. Savings are certainly possible that would have made the whole thing altogether more accessible. Navigation depends largely on consistent but ponderous menus written in cumbersome Javascript. Simple HTML navigation would have sufficed for much of this. A bewildering array of frames occupy the browser from time to time, but their multiplication is often unnecessary. A few design changes would make for an altogether less intimidating encounter.",8,2153,764,179,1,5
html body text p span  ,"So, it is arguable that",8,2349,139,17,1,5
html body text p i span  ,Electronic Beowulf,147,2349,127,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,"doesn't do much to empower the public or enhance our access to these highly prized assets: it simply disenfranchises us in a new way. There is an important lesson here for the political rhetoric of access. Either we need to strain every muscle to make sure that we make materials truly accessible (by providing tools like translations), or we need to be completely open about our design goals and manage expectations accordingly (it's really only for an academic audience). The former leaves us with a lot more work on our hands, the latter will leave us with much reduced funding. In the long run, either horn of the dilemma will be more comfortable than a disillusioned and excluded public.",8,2349,759,125,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The images will undoubtedly facilitate the preservation of the manuscript by allowing those readers already familiar with the text to address initial queries to the electronic version. Scholars who need access to the text will thus be better placed to identify the individual folios in question and thus approach the delicate manuscript more skilfully. Yet the digital copy presents its own preservation problems. A press release associated with the CD makes alarming reading, claiming that the CD is a 'complete electronic archive'. It certainly is not that.",8,2491,759,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The problems of digital archiving are beginning to be documented in slowly unfolding horror, not least by the",8,2597,702,17,1,5
html body text p a span  ,Archaeology Data Service,8,2615,173,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,and its colleagues in the,181,2615,157,17,1,5
html body text p a span  ,Arts and Humanities Data Service,338,2615,222,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,". A few of the problems are witnessed here, only a few months after the CD was released (March 2000). For example, the CD contains hypertext links to the British Library web site and the University of Kentucky where much of the development took place. Some of these links are already broken (assuming that they were correct in the first place) and there is no holding page to correct these errors. This demonstrates just one reason why CD is not the ideal medium for this sort of product.",8,2615,758,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Other reasons are perhaps more critical in the long term. At present there is no statutory deposit library in the UK for electronic materials, so there is no organisation mandated to maintain access to this CD-Rom in the long term. This is critical given the pace of change in digital technologies. Unscientific market research shows that computer stores in the York area sell few CD-Roms in comparison with Digital Versatile Discs. DVD's are compatible with CD's for the time being, but one can't help but think that the CD will soon join the Betamax and the Amstrad PCW in the technology which we wished we had migrated. If it were almost any organisation other than the British Library that was behind",8,2721,763,107,1,5
html body text p i span  ,Electronic Beowulf,8,2829,126,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,", it would be a real cause for concern. Given recent noises from the British Library and its developing manifesto on digital preservation, I am reassured that the data underlying this edition are indeed secure in the long term, even if the CD is not.",8,2829,750,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Again, however, there is a lesson here for policy makers and aspiring cultural or heritage access programmes. When we spend millions of pounds digitising, we really only want to do it once. We certainly don't want to have to do it again in five years time. Comprehensive guidance exists for digitisation and preservation of data, most of which recommends preservation from the outset (e.g. Smith",8,2899,765,71,1,5
html body text p a span  ,1998,267,2953,36,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,"). If we really do want to produce more CD-Roms, then we need to have some idea in mind regarding how we can make use of them in the long term too: which means we certainly need documentation and an idea of appropriate file formats. Once again, a little forethought may go a very long way. We certainly won't get the money to do this sort of digitisation work again, and will face quite an inquest if it goes wrong. The closure of the Millennium Dome at the end of 2000 has left the press looking for new scapegoats to blame for the misuse of taxpayers' money. Let's make sure we're not in their sights. Sustainability is not just a technical issue - it's a political one too.",8,2953,757,125,1,5
