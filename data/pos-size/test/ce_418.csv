html body text p span  ,"I'm going to put brief remarks in the record, but just sitting here thinking back over a lifetimeof my own if I had to figure out, Senator Levin, one or two disappointments in my lifetime -- thefirst was not achieving Navy gold wings. But unfortunately World War II had ended, and theydidn't need a lot of youngsters in the pipeline anymore and we all went home.",8,241,769,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"But, ever since then I've been highly envious of those of you who sought as your professions-- aviation. It's a very challenging, high-risk occupation.

html body text p span  ,That's a question that's very much on my mind as to whether that makes sense for us to dothat. But I agree with the chairman.

html body text p span  ,The program focuses on a new approach for weapons systems acquisition. We applied therecommendations of the Packard commission and other experts in acquisition reform. Wecreated an environment that provides early interaction between the warfighters and the technologists in order to be able to make cost and performance trades early. And that's been asignificant part of the program.,8,2671,760,71,1,5

html body text p span  ,All I can say to echo our Commandant is readiness is our business. And we stand by toanswer your questions.,8,3987,703,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"WARNER: All right, gentlemen. What I would like to do is to start with you, GeneralEberhart. And I presume you've had an opportunity to have reviewed to some extent the recordof this subcommittee as it reviewed the 22 program last year. And our major concern with thesubject of concurrency. Would you start, sort of as a threshold where we left off last year, howthe '96 program has unfolded to date, and what you would hope to do on concurrency issue inthe '97.",8,4021,755,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, I have reviewed the concurrency issue. With your permission, I'd like togo back just a little bit further though and talk about -- we were concerned with concurrencyfrom the very beginning to make sure that we were going to get this correct. As such, we lookedat what the Packard Commission said about concurrency.",8,4109,767,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: We think this program complies with the, what was pointed out in the PackardCommission. Rand looked at the concurrency issue. They commented favorably in terms ofconcurrency in the F-22. And just to make sure that we had it right, as you know, the DefenseScience Board looked at this issue and submitted a report in 1995, which in our view supportsthe fact that it's not too concurrent. There is some concurrency. We think there will beconcurrency in most all programs today. But we're comfortable with that concurrency. Wethink it's under control.",8,4179,768,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,WARNER: We added to be 70-odd aircraft in operational status before the last milestone iscompleted under -- is it the T&E program?,8,4285,755,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, before we go to full-rate production, there'll be 70-some-odd airplanes. Asyou know, when we looked at the acquisition reform of '94, they recommended approximately10 percent, which, if had we stayed with the original buy of about 700 and some-odd, 10 percentwould have been 70-some-odd. But as we've drawn down the total buy, and also extended theperiod of EMD, we think that's a natural consequence that we will in fact have more airplanes aswe go to full-rate production than this 10 percent guideline talks about.",8,4337,768,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"But we think the important parts -- and they have been, once again, authenticated by thereports that we talked about -- is first of all, the DT&E, which we think is most important, willbe finished essentially by the time we have four airplanes.",8,4443,755,53,1,5

html body text p span  ,WARNER: Right.,8,4581,116,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: And then the initial operations test and evaluation, the Rand Corporation saidmost problems unfold between the 10 and 20 percent point in IOT&E. And we will in fact have27 percent of IOT&E. For these reasons, sir, we believe that concurrency is just about right inthis program. We'll continue to watch it. We're concerned about it just as you are, but we thinkit's on the mark.",8,4615,758,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"WARNER: Now, each of the us have different views. I think it's, really, one of the highestrates of concurrency that I've experienced. But that, in your judgment -- and General Fogelmanhas testified this week before this committee -- that degree of concurrency is driven by thethreat assessment that has been made by a variety of sources, by traditional sources, such that tohave U.S. air dominance in the theater, in the time frame when this plane is scheduled to come in, it simply has to have that number of aircraft, and that design of aircraft, to meet that threat. Is that a fair summary?",8,4703,768,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, we're concerned about air dominance. We're concerned about insuringthat we have air dominance as quickly as possible. And in our view, the F-22 does that for us.But again, when you look at the number of airplanes, the 70-some- odd, by the time we go tofull rate, if we go back to some of the other factors we talked about in terms of an extendedEMD in having a bi-profile that makes sense.",8,4809,764,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"WARNER: Well, but it's the threat scenario that's driving that quantum of concurrency. Andthat depends on individuals to how you want to quantify it. I mean, you very carefully havequantified it from a technical perspective.",8,4897,762,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,WARNER: I just quantify it based on past experience. I mean this Committee has gonethrough a number of aircraft programs that have not materialized as originally envisioned. Let'stalk about your fly-away costs for 22. Considering the changes in the program to date -- andthere has been a reassessment of weight -- General Fogleman went into that. Did you have anopportunity to be debriefed on what he said on weight?,8,4949,750,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, Sir, I did.",8,5037,182,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"WARNER: To capsule the weight issue, as I recall it, was that he decided he could make adegradation in the envelope, and thereby allow an increase in the weight. And that degradationin his professional judgement would not substantially in any way affect the performance of thisaircraft to meet the threats. Is that correct?",8,5071,762,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, Sir. That's essentially correct. There's a little more to it, but that's...",8,5141,548,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"WARNER: Well, why don't you put that in?",8,5175,280,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, Sir. I think that when you look at the weight of the airplane, it's stillabout 2,500 pounds below what we think the max allowable weight would be for this airplane.We did look at -- and I think you know, and you referenced the testimony last year -- that in fact,at that time, we were concerned about the weight growth that we had seen to that time. Andwe've taken very aggressive measures to bring this under control. And we think we have todayto include weighing, to reviewing it every other week, to reporting it to the program manager.",8,5209,758,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"We have actually had the opportunity now to weigh some of the parts. In fact, we'veweighed about ten percent of the parts -- the actual parts that we've cut -- and we're plus 30pounds out of this whole 3,000 pounds that we've weighed. And then when we've look atavionics, we've weighed hundreds of pieces and we're minus ten pounds. So we think we havegood understanding that our model is on track.",8,5315,756,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The situation you're talking about is where we looked at the weight that we had at that time,and what it was going to take in terms of thrust to get us the G available at 1.0 on theperformance curve.",8,5403,744,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"We looked at what that would cost us in terms of dollars to insure a very small change in Gavailable. I'm talking .0 something in terms of Gs. Very negligible. We looked at what thatmeant in terms of operational capability. And we believed that was negligible -- and it wasn'tjust the Air Force, Sir, we vetted this and vetted this through the JROC process with the othervice chiefs, the vice chairman and the chairman and the CINCs to make sure everyone understood what this meant -- negligible in terms of operational capability. I guess the bottomline is we looked at it based on what it would cost us to keep that .0X amount of Gs at this onepoint on the performance curve, and we didn't think the cost was worth it.",8,5455,768,125,1,5
html body text p span  ,"WARNER: Let's return momentarily and then I'll yield to my colleague. About the fly-awaycost, what do you estimate the fly-away cost of 22 in the fiscal '96 dollars?",8,5597,758,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, I'll -- I get the fly-away costs confused a little bit here, so let me makesure that I understand it. I think it's around $70 million, but let me check that for you to makesure I have it right.",8,5649,767,35,1,5

html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, in terms of the reduced buy, coupled with stretching out EMD, there isless concurrency.",8,5973,678,17,1,5

html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: General, I want to talk to you about F-16s for a minute. We've got a new definitionof service life of the F-16s which is now driving us to purchase some additional F-16s. Andthere's a real question about whether that's the right way to go given our other needs in the AirForce. But let me try to work through this number with you. We have a 20 wing fighter forcenow and I gather the portion of that force that is made of F-16s is somewhat more than half. Doyou know off hand if that's correct?",8,18233,755,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, that sounds correct. I'll get the number here as you...",8,18339,452,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: OK, well, than maybe I better get these numbers for the record.",8,18373,462,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, sir.",8,18407,141,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: Let me tell you what I need, because you may not have them at your fingertips. What I need to know is what was the F-16 requirement when we had a 26-wing force, what wasthe F-16 requirement now, what would it have been had we gone to a 36-wing force, which was the goal during the early '90s?",8,18441,756,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,Those three items I need and how many F-16s would have made up those three differentforce structures. Then I need you to translate that into both the old definition and the newdefinition of service life in terms of how many available F-16s we got. And that's somethingyou can provide us for the record.,8,18511,762,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, sir.",8,18581,141,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: Do you know in general whether or not the number of F-16 fighter wingequivalence has changed over the recent past? Do you know that offhand?,8,18615,734,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, it is changed, obviously, as we've drawn down some F-16s, and we canthink of wings like the 474th at Nellis and other wings that have drawn down. And as airplaneshave aged, it's certainly changed, although the other fighter force structure is changed, too.",8,18667,756,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"So I don't have on the tip of my tongue what the relationship in terms of proportion of forceis in terms of change, but we'd like to show that to you for the record and the proportion of thedifferent blocks, how they've changed...",8,18737,749,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: All right.,8,18789,114,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: ...because that's what complicates this issue, as you know.",8,18823,461,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: Right. That's fine. Are you familiar with the Coalition Force EnhancementProgram? Does that strike a bell?,8,18857,745,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: I think I...no, sir.",8,18891,198,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: OK. This was a program that would have given the F-16s some improvedcapability, upgraded them, added some service life. And we can find that in a different way.",8,18925,739,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, sir, I am familiar with that program.",8,18977,351,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: OK. Was it our plan to use that program and sell those upgraded F-16 to our allies?,8,19011,588,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, our hope was to do just that and then have a device or a procedure wherethat money is supposed to be returned to the Treasury would be returned to the United States AirForce to buy these attrition reserve airplanes that we've just discussed.",8,19045,769,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: Do you know the cost of adding 4000 hours of service life to a plane under thatprogram?,8,19115,625,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: No, sir, I do not know. One of our big problems right now is that as we'velooked around on this and how much we would have to sell those for, I think the brutal facts arethere are no buyers.",8,19149,760,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: They want to...,8,19201,153,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,EBERHART: Just as soon have a new airplane.,8,19235,303,17,1,5

html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Yes, sir.",8,19303,141,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: As I understand it, the budget would cut the JSTARS procurement in half duringfiscal years '99, 2000, and 2001, buying one instead of two during those fiscal years?",8,19337,737,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, my recollection was that we did, in fact, move one airplane right. I wasn'taware that we moved three right. I thought we moved one right. I'll have to provide that for therecord.",8,19389,760,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: Can you tell us what the experience with the J-STARS was in the Persian Gulf War,in Bosnia?",8,19441,659,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,LEVIN: Are the CINCs interested in more JSTARS?,8,19475,337,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, the CINCs are very interested in the JSTARS program as it exists todayand the planned improvements as we get on through the production line.",8,19509,676,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Obviously, as you know, the bird that we have today and the production birds will be muchmore capable than the bird that we had in the Persian Gulf. And that -- we were all amazed bywhat it was able to do in such short notice.",8,19561,753,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"I think that in Bosnia today, people are impressed with what it's doing, although it's adifferent situation because of the topography, we don't have a pool table, if you will, like we hadin Desert Storm or like we imagined in the central region of Europe.",8,19613,768,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"But we have tools where we can go and take this and show the CINC that if you bringJSTARS here and you put it in this orbit, this is what you're going to be able to see aroundSarajevo. This is what you're not going to be able to see. So that the expectations are there andhe fully understands what this tool will bring to him as a CINC. And that's exactly what we didbefore we deployed JSTARS, so it's living up to the expectations, and it's allowing us to use it inways in peacekeeping and peace making that we hadn't envisioned using in a major regionalcontingency. So everybody's very impressed with what they see in terms of JSTARS now. Andfrankly, the move right was an affordability issue to make sure that everything would fit.",8,19683,760,125,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: Well, that's what troubles me is that we've got a new technology and a newplatform, which is working extremely well from everything we can learn, and we're moving thatto the right for affordability reasons.",8,19825,709,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"And then, we're spending money buying F-16s and F-15s for attrition reserves, which areonly created by the changing the program life expectancy of planes.

html body text p span  ,"I mean, it just seems to me there's a disconnect here where we've got a real need of a newtechnology that is proving itself every day in Bosnia and has proven itself in -- over many, manymonths in the Persian Gulf, and that we're delaying and using money to create a reserve whichreally, it seems to me, is not a realistic need when you consider the fact that we've reduced thenumber quite dramatically of how many F-16s we're going to need because of the reduction infighter wings.",8,19947,758,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"So, to me, it's a priority which is misplaced, but I'm not asking you to agree or disagree withthat so much as I need from you for the record the history of the F-16s when we had 26 fighterwings. Now that it's down to 20 what would have been had we -- the requirement -- what therequirement would have been had we gone up to 35? The impact on the -- on that requirementwhen we changed the service life expectancy of the F-16 and then we can put all that togetherand reach our own conclusion. But at least that's certainly my tentative conclusion.",8,20053,768,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"EBERHART: Sir, we'll certainly provide that and the chief shares your concerns there. Maybe not necessarily versus the F-16 but the importance of that JSTARS and we are relookingthat now as we build the '98 to '03 program.",8,20159,746,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: OK. Thank you. And then my last question, General Magnus, has to do with theC130-J aircraft, and I understand that you'd like to begin buying a tanker version of that aircraft.Is that correct?",8,20211,704,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"MAGNUS: Senator, our current active force has 37 35 year old KC130-Fs and an additional14 slightly younger KC130-Rs. Based upon what our projection of the service life of thoseaircraft are, unfortunately the bulk of them are going to come due for block service liferetirement just exactly when we need to invest in aircraft like the joint strike fighter and V-22and the Navy's F/A-18EF. We have been monitoring the United States Air Forces C130-J program. We are enormously impressed with the improvements in the cockpits and the avionicsin the performance of the air craft. We believe it would be prudent for us to be able toessentially piggy back on that program. Fiscal resource constraints have not enabled us to dothat at this time.",8,20263,761,125,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: Now you just completed, did you not, the modernization of your tactical tankers acouple of years ago?",8,20405,712,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"MAGNUS: That's correct. We still have some other things that are being modernized interms of radios, global position, satellite com. So, there is a continuing strain, but essentiallythat is correct.",8,20439,764,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"LEVIN: And despite that recent completion of that modernization program, you want to startbuying some new tankers for reasons that you gave?",8,20491,758,35,1,5
html body text p span  ,"MAGNUS: Well, essentially the modernization that we're talking about, that the Senator isreferring to, is sub-systems. Our concern is service life, fatigue life of the aircraft. Theseaircraft are 35 years old. We would have to spend an enormous amount more money to basically do a service life extension on these aircraft when we have aircraft that are beingproduced for the United States Air Force. They're going to have very low ownership costs, justas ours are spiking.",8,20543,765,71,1,5
html body text p span  ,"So, we believe it prudent not to invest in schlepping old aircraft when in fact they're going tobe very cost effective in terms of life cycle costs and commonality. Very cost effective --C130-Js being produced for our wing men in the United States Air Force. So we look forward tobeing able to take advantage of that program.",8,20631,767,53,1,5
