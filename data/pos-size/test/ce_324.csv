This ion-pair is very short-lived, another nucleophile-electrophilebonding reaction leads to the product (1,2-dibromobutane). Inreaction #3 (a substitution reaction) the electrophilic carbonyl carbon atom bonds to thenucleophilic oxygen atom of ethyl alcohol to give an intermediate (insquare brackets) that eliminates HCl, yielding the ester ethyl acetate.

html body text form p span  ,"Lastly, reactions #3 and #6 illustrate differences in the reactivity ofcarbonyl compounds. We know that the carbon atom of a carbonylgroup is electrophilic and undergoes reaction with a variety ofnucleophiles. However, this electrophilic character may be enhancedor diminished by substituents. If we take saturated aldehydes (RCH=O) as a reference, the additional alkyl substituent present in ketonesslightly reduces this electrophilicity, but the general reactivitypattern of these classes is similar. On the other hand, a chlorinesubstituent is inductively electron withdrawing and increasesthe electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon significantly.
