But today's purchaser of, say, a cable modem connection to the Internet from AT&T-Excite-@Home is purchasing a bundle of present goods and future services, and is making a down payment on the establishment of a long-termrelationship with AT&T-Excite-@Home. Once the relationship is established, both buyer and seller find themselves in different positions. Adam Smith's images are less persuasive in the context of services - especially services that require deep knowledge of the customer's wants and situation(and of the maker's capabilities) - that are not, by their nature, fungibleor easily comparable.",48,5768,687,179,1,6

html body text blockquote p span  ,"It might seem that anything that encourages transparency must be good. Indeed, all other things being equal, for consumers, for merchants selling products that can survive scrutiny, and for the economy as a whole, increasesin the transparency of product markets are always a good thing. The issue, however, is to what extent this logic justifies a transparent consumer.",48,17669,674,71,1,6
html body text blockquote p span  ,"The answer is fundamentally political. It depends on the extent to which one is willing to recognize privacy as an end in itself. If information about consumers is just a means to an economic end, there is no reason for concern. If, on the other hand, citizens perceive maintaining control over facts about their economic actions as a good in itself, some sort of governmental intervention in the market may be needed to make it easier for this preference to express itself.",48,17757,688,89,1,6

We have not, for example, discussed the extent to which the replacement of human salespeople, travel agents and shop assistants will affect the labor market.",48,17907,679,89,1,6
html body text blockquote p span  ,"The consequences may be earthshaking. For about two centuries starting in 1800, technological progress was the friend of the unskilled worker. It provided a greater relative boost to the demand for workers who were relatively unskilled (who could tighten bolts on the assembly line, or move things about so that the automated production process could use them, or watch largely self-running machines and call for help when they stopped) than for those who were skilled. The spread of industrial civilization was associated with a great leveling in the distribution of income. But there is nothing inscribed in the nature of reality to the effect that technological progress must always boost the relative wages of the unskilled.",48,18013,677,125,1,6

While this may benefit the mass audience, it has harmful effects on one elite. It risks creating an academic proletariat made up of those who would have been well-paid professors before the triumph of ""distance learning"" over the lecture hall.",48,18155,682,125,1,6
