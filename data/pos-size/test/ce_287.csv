Always flying just under the radar by being available as take-out and at some deli counters, the appeal for Asian-inspired foods will propel mass production by manufacturers. Frozen meals and meal kits (perhaps in the refrigerated section because of the heavy veggie component) will be the first to show development.",221,750,550,89,1,10

In 2001 we saw 'mystery' ketchup colors, blue french fries, and, most recently, green pancake syrup from the Mrs Butterworth's brand. In essence, products that were already kid-friendly got more so. In 2002, however, we expect to find that kids are going to be the target for products that have been considered only to be appealing to the adult market. For example, coffee. Coffee drinkers are getting younger, and with the growing appeal of RTD iced coffees and the mammoth spread of Starbucks, we predict that there will soon be a kid-targeted coffee drink.",221,1358,554,143,1,10

We expect more of a musical tie-in with alcoholic beverages next year, as artists continue to incorporate them into their songs and videos.
