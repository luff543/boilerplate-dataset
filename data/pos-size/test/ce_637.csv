html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"For most of his adult life, from about the age of 30 until his death at 78 inthe year 1642, Galileo propounded his theory of how the tides work. Yet alengthy summary of our understanding of the tides that the British physicistLord Kelvin published in 1882 mentions Galileo only in passing.",15,237,456,89,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Why the cursory treatment? Because Galileo's theory of the tides, whileextremely well thought out and eminently reasonable considering the state ofscientific knowledge at the time, was wrong. Indeed, it was the mostsignificant stumble in an otherwise brilliant scientific career. A look backat Galileo's big mistake offers clues to how and why such a great thinker couldhave made it, and what lessons it can offer us today.",15,343,456,107,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"It was in 1595 when Galileo, just shy of his 30th birthday, first cameup with his explanation for the tides. The idea occurred to him while travelingon a barge that was ferrying freshwater to Venice. (Galileo lived in nearbyPadua and often visited Venice.) He noticed that whenever the barge's speed ordirection altered, the freshwater inside sloshed around accordingly. If thevessel suddenly ground to a halt on a sandbar, for instance, the water pushedup towards the bow then bounced back toward the stern, doing this several timeswith ever decreasing agitation until it returned to a level state.",15,549,464,161,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Galileo realized that the Earth's dual motion—its daily one around its axisand its annual one around the sun—might have the same effect on oceans andother great bodies of water as the barge had on its freshwater cargo. The key,as Galileo saw it, was that even though we don't sense it, different parts ofour planet move at different speeds depending on the time of day. It's as ifthe Earth were a barge, which sped up, slowed down, and periodically changeddirection.",15,727,461,125,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"In his ""Treatise on the Tides,"" a paper he wrote in 1616, Galileo used adiagram to explain why he thought this was true (see animated version at right above). In this animation, the Earth revolves in a counterclockwise direction both on its axis and around the sun.",15,869,459,71,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Galileo demonstrated that the combination of the two motions—the so-called""absolute motion""—is always fastest on the part of the circle near A,because that part is moving in the same direction for both the daily and annualmovements. And it is always slowest on the part of the circle near B, becausethat part is moving in opposite directions for the daily and annual movements.He determined that because the two absolute motions are additive on one side ofthe globe and subtractive on the other, the extreme ends of any sufficientlylarge basin of water, such as the Mediterranean Sea, would be moving atdifferent speeds. The daily acceleration and deceleration of that body ofwater, he reasoned, effects a sloshing within it—the tides.",15,957,459,197,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"The chief objection to Galileo's argument was that his model should have calledfor only one high tide a day, whereas there are roughly two. Galileo explainedthis away by stating that many other factors play a role in creating a specifictidal situation. These include the length of a basin, its orientation, itsdepth, the shape of its coasts, the effect of winds, and so forth.",15,1171,464,107,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,A sensible theory,15,1336,111,17,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Galileo thought he had discovered the correct explanation for the tides, one that wouldsink the other leading hypothesis of the day—namely, that the moon triggeredthe tides. In 1609, the German mathematician Johannes Kepler had written, ""Thesphere of influence of the attraction which is in the moon extends as far asthe Earth, and incites the waters up from the torrid zone...."" But becauseKepler and other proponents of the moon theory could offer no scientificexplanation for such influence, Galileo, who worked strictly on the basis ofwhat he could see with his own eyes, found it impossible to believe; the theorysmacked of the occult, he declared. (It wasn't until Sir Isaac Newton publishedhis law of universal gravitation in 1687 that Kepler's ""attraction"" gained afirm scientific footing. Today, of course, most schoolchildren know that Keplerwas right: the moon's gravitational tug gives rise to the tides.)",15,1377,465,233,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Galileo also thought his tidal theory provided powerful support for the notionthat the Earth revolved around the sun (and not the other way around, asvirtually everyone in the world then believed). This notion was first advancedin the mid-16th century by the Polish astronomer NicolausCopernicus, who maintained that our planet's rotation and revolution around thesun accounted for the apparent movement of the heavenly bodies. Galileobelieved in the Copernican rather the Ptolemaic system, which had held swayever since Aristotle and his successor Ptolemy. The Ptolemaic view, that theEarth was the center of the universe and all heavenly bodies revolved aroundit, was insinuated by Catholic teachings to be supported by the Bible andwas therefore upheld by the Vatican.",15,1627,465,215,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Even as he published his tidal theory in 1616, however, Galileo may have hadsome lingering doubts about it. At the end of the ""Treatise,"" he says he hopeshis idea ""does not turn out to be delusive, like a dream which gives a briefimage of truth followed by an immediate certainty of falsity. This I submit tothe judgment of intelligent investigators."" Such scientific investigators wouldnot appear for some time, and then, alas, they would judge him wrong.",15,1859,462,125,1,9

At one point, for example, one of the book'sthree main characters, Salviati, who is a thinly disguised stand-in forGalileo, says, ""Among all the famous men who have philosophized [about thetides], I wonder more at Kepler than any of the rest. Though he is a free andacute genius, he has lent his assent to the moon's dominance over the oceansand to other occult happenings and other such trifles.""",15,2331,457,125,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Einstein had keen insights on why Galileo acted so rashly. First of all, it wasGalileo's longing to find a mechanical proof of the Earth's motion, Einsteinfelt, that misled him into not only formulating but clinging so tenaciously tohis flawed theory on the tides. The planet's motion accounts for the tides,Galileo posited, and the tides account for the planet's motion—it was all soneat. Moreover, all Galileo's astronomical observations convinced him thatCopernicus was correct, and he wanted desperately to prove that factscientifically. As Einstein put it, ""His aim was to substitute for a petrifiedand barren system of ideas the unbiased and strenuous quest for a deeper andmore consistent comprehension of the physical and astronomicalfacts.""",15,2715,460,197,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"Even Galileo's greatest blunder reveals his greatest strength as a scientist.Referring to the tidal theory, Stillman Drake, a leading Galileo scholar, oncewrote, ""The prime source of Galileo's effectiveness was his bringing togetherof mathematics, astronomy, and physics in an inseparable relationship. Henceeven a questionable example of such a relationship given by him was stillcapable of revealing to others what sort of thing should be sought after inconstructing a scientific explanation.""
