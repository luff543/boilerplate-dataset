Puddly and soft wet soil is a requisite to the growth of rice up to the end of the tillering stage. When the soil is puddly and soft there are relatively wide spaces between the soil particles, there is a low percentage of the solid phase and both bulk density and hardness are low. These conditions favour rice plant growth and absorption of nutrients. After a number of years, with repeated cycles of puddling, the formed plow-layer will encourage much better water control.",80,340,684,107,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,Drainage of the rice field between the end of the tillering stage and the panicle differentiation stage will lead to higher yields. Rice roots will extend more deeply and stems grow more strongly. Drainage will increase the portion of the most active white roots of the rice plant and will decrease the number of non-active black roots. This drainage will also cause the soil to become more hard and compact by sun drying. According Cheng (1984) the presence of white roots against black roots is a good indicator that sufficient drainage has been applied.,80,448,691,107,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td font span  ,The main aim for the water management is to promote leaching/percolation by controlled drainage during periods with rainfall.

Pump irrigation during this period should be highly recommended for real high yields. Water supply may include acid canal water as it has little effect on the yield and can be used to provide sufficient percolation.,80,556,688,107,1,13

In wet years the drop of groundwater will hardly occur during the dry season. Therefore an field drainage system is required. For the Acid Sulphate soils it is essential that sufficient percolation can be applied after the dry season, during the next growing season. In these conditions the El NiÃ±o effect of 1997/98 resulted in peak high yields for the following growing season in the Telang project of South Sumatra province.The same positive effect in acid sulphate soils has been recorded for the Saleh project (South Sumatra) in 1994/95, also after an extreme long dry season.
