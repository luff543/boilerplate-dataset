Be aware that each interview and interviewer is different and, as such, these notes should not be taken as the ""golden rule"". You should speak to as many advisors, med students & fellow applicants as soon as possible to get their insights on interviewing.",133,154,634,107,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"The medical school interview (MSI) brings the applicant's numbers and essays to life and, with adequate preparation, can really boost an application. Though MCAT scores and GPAs are a mediocre index of how well a person might do in med school and decides whether an applicant is granted an MSI, they offer nothing to assess personality or suitability for a career in medicine. With decreasing importance of the MCAT at many schools and a strong desire by medical schools to train compassionate physicians, the MSI has a central role in admissions.",133,418,641,107,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Being selected for a MSI is a significant achievement in itself. The admissions process essentially involves reducing a large applicant pool to a relatively small number of competitive applicants. The MSI is an imperfect means of selecting the best potential MDs from among this group. Basically, the MSI is designed to substantiate your application by subjectively evaluating your compatibility with the school and motivations for pursuing an MD. Also, time is allowed for a question/answer period about the school itself. This is quite a difficult task in an interview that lasts only 20 minutes!",133,542,642,107,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Time spent in preparation for the MSI is time well-spent. The admissions panel will place a great deal of importance on your interview report, and confidence going into the MSI is essential. You don't need to spend hours preparing answers to ""standard"" MSI questions, but you should review the most commonly asked interview questions.",133,700,643,71,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Unfortunately, MSI questions can come in an infinite number of forms. The solution: ""study"" the basics. Although there are no standard MSI questions, certain general topics invariably come up: your college, work and extracurricular experiences; your motivation for becoming a physician; and your ""uniqueness"". Read and re-read your AMCAS Personal Statement and other essays. Be prepared to talk in further detail about anything mentioned in your application. Go back and study your notes and any publications you might have from research projects; re-read your best history paper, the article you wrote for",133,788,634,125,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Think back on your various extracurricular pursuits. What did they mean to you and how did they influence your motivation to become a physician? Really think about why you want to go to medical school. What do you hope to accomplish and contribute to medicine? How do you know what being an MD is like? Think about your strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. If you're a junior researcher, why aren't you pursuing just a Ph.D.? Where is your research going and what would you do next? Be aware of any new developments in your application which you may want to bring up at the MSI: any recent awards or achievements? You might mention other activities unrelated to medicine: current volunteer tutoring, athletic participation, a musical performance or an interesting trip for spring break is worth discussing and could liven a stalled MSI. These are just guidelines to ""organize"" your brain; the best preparation is to know yourself and to have solid reasons for seeking an MD.",133,930,643,197,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"The admissions panel will certainly want to know why you're applying to their school. Therefore, research the school thoroughly before going for your MSI. Read the school's catalog and review the Stanford ""red Books"" (surveys of Stanford graduates attending med schools). Use this information wisely during the question/answer period of your MSI. Construct insightful questions about the medical school program. Well thought-out questions demonstrate that you have researched their program and are enthusiastic about the school. Don't ask about their grading system or vacation schedule; this is blatantly obvious in their catalog.",133,1144,638,125,1,10

Topics such as in-vitro fertilization, abortion, euthanasia, socialized medicine, the AIDS epidemic and the high costs of medicine are often brought up as an exercise in current awareness and logical thought. When discussing such topics, substantiate what you believe with what you know. Try not to get defensive. There are no right or wrong answers. Think about how you would try to address the issues.",133,1322,632,107,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Take notes on your MSI ""performances"": what went well, what went wrong? This strategy will help you improve subsequent MSI performance. You should also plan to re-read your entire application to a school the night before your MSI, just to refresh your memory. To come across well at the MSI, you need to express yourself well: be concise and articulate. Learning to relax with difficult questions is important in handling the stress of an MSI.",133,1446,640,89,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Nightmares abound regarding stressful interviews and you've likely heard the rumors. From my experience and common consensus, pressure-type interviews are far less common than the ""laid-back, Californian"" variety. Granted, the MSI is an anxiety-ridden experience and some form of self-imposed stress reaction is normal. Fortunately, the process gets much easier with experience and, by your 3rd or 4th MSI, you may find yourself more relaxed than your interviewer! Remember that most interviewers are volunteers for the job and as such: a) usually enjoy meeting people and interviewing; b) were all once in your shoes; and c) don't bite (usually).",133,1656,641,125,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"In the unfortunate event that you run into someone who asks you to open a nailed-shut office window, keep your composure and play along with it. If dealing with the former, stick with your answer and substantiate it. If a question seems vague or offensive, don't immediately jump in without thinking. Try to clarify what's being asked and to pin the interviewer down to a specific question. If this doesn't work, punt:",133,1798,616,89,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p em span  ,"""Well, that's a very interesting question. I'd have to think about that for a while.""",133,1870,633,35,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Interview formats vary from school to school. Prior to your interview trip, talk with medical students, your advisors and friends who have interviewed at the school to get details. On the average, you will receive 2 one-on-one interviews, often one with a faculty member and one with a medical student. Other varieties do exist with multiple interviewers or multiple interviewees. Interviews may be ""blind"", where the interviewer has not yet read your file, or they may be based on a thorough review. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. In a blind interview you may not have to explain your C- in Weed Out Chemistry 101, but you're more likely to have to tell your complete life story to a stranger. In a reviewed MSI, often the interviewer has been selected for you based on common academic interests (a molecular biologist for an undergrad biochemistry researcher, for example). This underscores the need for complete honesty and avoidance of exaggeration. The interviewer probably knows more about your specialty than you, and half truths really stand out.",133,1922,643,215,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,Another point about MSIs is that they often don't take the full scheduled time allotment (generally 1 hour). MSIs can be as short as 20 minutes to longer than 2 hours. Note: the length of an interview is not a reliable indicator of how well or how poorly an MSI went: it's the content that matters.,133,2154,640,53,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"The MSI is designed to fill the gaps in your personal statement: are you charismatic, enthusiastic, friendly and warm? The MSI also serves to assess communication skills: do you have fluid and articulate speech? Medical schools are also looking for people who are oriented to the school's strong programs: a researcher-type might have a tougher time gaining acceptance to a school that primarily trains Family Practitioners and vice versa.",133,2258,623,89,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Interviewers like to see an applicant who follows what's going on in the world, not someone buried completely under books.

Also realize that your interviewer will ask you two basic types of questions: those that you're expected to know and those that are geared to test your comprehension and analytical abilities. You aren't expected to know everything, so don't be afraid to say, ""I don't know"". It's often looked upon very favorably when a student has the courage to admit this. Don't bluff or give a hand-waving explanation this is easy to spot. Finally, you may be asked how you rank their school: be honest. If it's your number one choice, by all means tell them. If not, state enthusiastically that you are strongly considering them (otherwise you'd be wasting your time and money), but that you haven't finished visiting/interviewing at all schools yet.",133,2488,635,161,1,10

Topics like pregnancy, raising children, marriage, etc. are taboo, but might be asked. Keep your cool and answer honestly.

But, if the MSI went badly, you can defend yourself in a letter to the Director of Admissions stating what was unfair.

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Remember not to sell yourself short - go into the MSI believing you're a very special person who could ""do their school proud"". If you don't toot your horn, no one else will. Just do it in moderation. You need to walk the fine line between humility and conceit to get your best attributes across to your interviewer. Conversely, be aware of your weak points as these may also come up in the discussion. I realize that Stanford students have few weaknesses, but it's important to have identified a few beforehand. Typical responses like ""I tend to get involved in too many activities, but I never let my performance be compromised"" are overused. You can do better - just add a positive note.",133,2858,644,125,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Relax and, if possible, enjoy your interview. Interviewers are genuinely interested in meeting and making next year's class a strong one, so generalized terror probably isn't warranted. Try to express a confident and positive attitude.",133,3000,634,53,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"If you are shy, it may take longer than the allotted time to get things rolling. Monosyllabic responses and lack of enthusiasm are not exciting conversation. This perception may carry over to your evaluation. Practice making strong first impressions when meeting people. Schedule a mock interview at UAC to reinforce this. You need to come across as a warm and sensitive person with excellent potential.",133,3070,643,89,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"A word of caution: try not to monopolize the interview or get too verbose. This leaves a very negative impression. If an interviewer gets on a tangent and you feel that you haven't quite touched on all the major bases it's OK to tactfully and cautiously guide the interview in a more productive direction. As for physical appearance, applicants stick out in their pressed blue blazers and conservative dresses among the faded jeans and unshaven faces of the local med students (and even their interviewers on occasion). Nonetheless, professional and conservative dress is strongly recommended, as it is a token of respect and reflects a serious attitude. You might argue that you have a right to ""express yourself"" through your clothing, but why risk it? You should dress so that the interviewer won't think about your attire but about you. This translates to a 3-piece suit or jacket and tie for men, a business-type dress for women.",133,3176,640,179,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"You should think about your body language and how this may affect your interviewer. Specifically, try not to fidget or tap your feet. Nervousness is normal; try to quell this with an occasional deep breath. Don't stare outside or at the clock. Express interest in what both of you are saying by leaning slightly forward and keeping eye contact with your interviewer.",133,3372,642,71,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"One last word of advice on MSI etiquette: don't take the medical student interview too lightly. Their reports carry just as much clout as a faculty MSI. Therefore, don't be cocky or confide something to a student that you would never say to a professor. Remember that student and faculty are working together and you might get burned.",133,3460,639,71,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,". The Admissions Committee reviews your GPA, MCAT scores, personal statement, secondary application and letters of recommendation, and then somehow decides whom to interview (See Ruby and Nancy on how to go about getting one). The percentage of applicants interviewed depends on the particular school - often only a small fraction are granted an MSI. Once you've been granted an interview, pat yourself on the back and/or congratulate yourself in some fashion. You've made the big cut and are one of a few highly competitive applicants being considered. Often a school will assign you a date and time that may be difficult to accommodate, especially if on the east coast. Generally, the Admissions Staff is flexible and will arrange another date as need be.",133,3582,641,161,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"If you haven't heard from a school but will be ""in the neighborhood"" on the opposite coast, it is acceptable to call or write a school well in advance of your trip to request an MSI. Give the school at least 3-4 weeks leeway, the dates of your trip and a polite letter. It's OK to call if you haven't gotten a response in a couple of weeks. It isn't OK, however, to walk up to their doorstep and request an interview on the spot.",133,3760,630,89,1,10

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"Some schools will offer a regional MSI; there is no known disadvantage with respect to admission by opting for a regional.

html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"You're probably asking, ""How can I afford a deluxe MSI vacation?"" Ticketing as far in advance as possible helps lower travel costs. Try to group schools regionally to save time and money; if you've arranged a group of 2 or more east coast schools, you can get special fares with unlimited travel for 21 days (try Continental and American). This often takes several phone calls back and forth to the admissions offices to juggle interview dates. 5-Star accommodations can often be arranged with a local medical student or in the medical school dormitory for a reasonable price (this is also a great way to meet the ""locals""); call the admissions office for details.",133,4024,636,125,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"One final thought: the interviewing ""season"" often extends until May. Generally, the earlier you complete your AMCAS and secondary applications, the earlier your file is reviewed for interview.

Don't read too deeply into your interviewer's comments or the atmosphere of your discussion, however. Remember that the comment, ""I hope to see you here next year"" is only coming from one member of the admissions panel. Conversely, a perceived ""bad"" interview may reflect the interviewer's personality, and s/he may have been expressionlessly but thoroughly impressed by you. Moreover, one marginal MSI may be entirely negated by another excellent one. My advice: think positive and cross your fingers.",133,4288,642,107,1,10
html body text table tbody tr td span p span  ,"You will definitely have the opportunity to discover lots of information about the school and its environs (elicited by your insightful questions as discussed above, remember?). Take a tour or, if your MSI is regional, plan on seeing the school well before enrolling. Talk to as many students as possible and inquire about the overall quality of lectures and clinical education. Do senior medical students think they received a quality education? Also, try to assess the quality of life, the climate, your prospective peers and the cultural/recreational activities available. Think about your family and friend support network - how would it change? Is this important? How would you, individually, fit into the medical school?",133,4412,643,143,1,10

A few words of caution on each: some lesser schools gear their teaching toward performance on the Nat'l. Boards (rather than the art of medicine). As such, their students score much higher than normal. Remember that your patients won't have a 3 x 5 index card on their forehead with labeled options. As for claims like: ""90% of our graduating class matched their top 3 choices"", regard such statements with a certain amount of skepticism as well.
