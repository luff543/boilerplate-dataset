html body text p span  ,"Everyone wants to know when those lines will cross, meaningall must-fix bugs have been fixed. Part of the answer comes fromknowing how fast open bugs will be resolved. But another part ofit comes from knowing how many new must-fix bugs can be expected.Our argument in this section is as follows:",8,1742,746,53,1,5
html body text ol li span  ,Estimating this number is extremely difficult.,48,1812,291,17,1,6

html body text p span  ,"To estimate this number, the natural tendency is to do somesort of curve-fitting (by using a ruler, a spreadsheet, or somemore sophisticated tool). If you do, your extrapolations willlikely be wildly wrong, because that curve is due to a changingmixture of completed tasks, tasks in progress, and tasks not yetbegun, each with a different rate of finding bugs.

html body text p b span  ,Comparing apples and oranges,8,2230,213,17,1,6
html body text p span  ,The spreadsheet above assumes that bugs will be found atroughly the same rate throughout a task. That's unlikely. Atypical graph of cumulative bugs discovered vs. working time (whichis more meaningful than calendar time) will look like this:,8,2264,737,53,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The reason for the curve is that different activities arelumped together in one task. Early in the task, the tester islearning an area of the product and designing tests. While testdesign does find bugs, the rate of bug discovery is lower thanwhen the tests are run for the first time. So, when testexecution begins, the curve turns up. As testing proceeds, anincreasing amount of time will be spent in regression testing (especiallychecking bug fixes). Because rerunning a test is less likely tofind a bug than running it for the first time, the curve beginsto flatten out.",8,2559,767,89,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Your estimates will be more accurate if you track test design,first-time execution, and regression testing separately.",8,2665,736,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Notes:,8,2699,42,17,1,5
html body text ol li span  ,"We don't pretend that test execution doesn't have an element of design in it - while running tests, testers get ideas for new tests, which they then execute. But counting that ""embedded design"" as test execution should do no harm to what are already rough estimates. Major discoveries should make you schedule additional explicit tasks to be tracked separately.",48,2733,726,71,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,"The beginning of test execution will probably find more bugs than the end, because it's common for testers to run the most promising tests first. Even if tests were run in random order, some bugs are obvious enough that many of the tests will find them. While this ""front-loading"" of bugs might skew your estimates, you certainly don't want to improve them by intentionally finding bugs later!",48,2805,728,71,1,6
html body text ol li span  ,"You might find it most useful not to track retesting of bug fixes. Instead, simply assume that some percentage of fixed bugs will cause new bugs that will later be found by retesting.

If that's the case - if yourstabilization phase is anything but stable and you're reallydoing mostly guerrilla testing - there's no point in presentingwildly inaccurate estimates at the project status meeting.Concentrate on answering the other questions presented in thispaper.",8,3365,767,89,1,5

html body text ul li span  ,"Don't get into this situation. By the time the stabilization phase is well enough underway that this graph becomes the focus of attention, you should have made some progress on all testing tasks. That almost certainly means some context switching. For example, the tester responsible for the scenario testing task will have to stop part-way through and do some configuration testing. That's annoying, disruptive, and reduces efficiency - but only if you take a tester-centric view of the universe, one where getting testing done is the primary goal. Your team's primary goal is discovering useful information and making it available as early as possible. The project manager needs to know if there are configuration problems before the last minute.",48,3711,722,125,1,6
html body text ul li span  ,"Extrapolate using numbers for testing that's already underway. For example, both ""test printing"" and ""test editing"" are functional tests of discrete subsystems. If the printing subsystem is half the size of the editing subsystem, and half as much testing is planned, you might reasonable predict half as many fatal bugs will be discovered. There are, of course, many variables that might confound that estimate: the programmer who wrote the printing code may be a much better programmer, the size metric you used (be it lines of code, number of branches, function points, programmer hours spent) may not capture the relative bugginess of the two subsystems, and so on. However, it's a better estimate than simply guessing, and it will improve rapidly as real testing begins.",48,3837,729,125,1,6
