html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"""Yes, I want a boat,"" he admitted. ""I'd like to do a bit of sailing. A friend of mine was here and had a chap named Rowsell--Job Rowsell. Either of you answer to that name, by chance?""",17,290,722,35,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,The two boatmen looked at one another. The one who had addressed him first turned a little away.,17,532,627,17,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"""He's no lazy, sir,"" he said. ""That's not the right word. But he's come into money some way or other, Job Rowsell has. There's none of us knows how, and it ain't our business, but he spends most of his time in the public-house and he seems to have taken a fancy for night sailing alone, which to my mind, and there are others of us as say the same, ain't none too healthy an occupation. And that's all there is to be said of Job Rowsell, as I knows of.""",17,788,737,71,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"""It's a good deal, too,"" Granet remarked thoughtfully. ""Where does he live?""",17,876,487,17,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Rowsell stared at him for a moment but acquiesced. They pulled across and boarded the Saucy Jane. A boy whom they found on the deck took the boat back. Rowsell set his sails slowly but with precision. The moment he stepped on board he seemed to become an altered man.,17,1460,733,53,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,The man eyed him sullenly. A few minutes later they were rushing out of the harbour.,17,1770,547,17,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"They reached St. Agnes before they came round on the first tack. Then, with the spray beating in their faces, they swung around and made for the opening between the two islands. For a time the business of sailing kept them both occupied. In two hours' time they were standing out towards Bishop Lighthouse. Job Rowsell took a long breath and filled a pipe with tobacco. He was looking more himself now.",17,1838,735,71,1,9

html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,Rowsell obeyed but his face grew darker. He leaned towards his passenger.,17,2114,480,17,1,9
html body text table tbody tr td p span  ,"""What's your game?"" he demanded hoarsely. ""There's some of them on the island'd have me by the throat if they only knew the things I could tell 'em. What's your game here, eh? Are you on the cross?""",17,2148,719,35,1,9

There was a great indenture in the rocks up which the sea came hissing; to the left, round the corner, the lighthouse.

The submarine grew nearer and Granet tossed a small roll of paper across the chasm of waters. All that passed between the two men was to Job Rowsell unintelligible.
