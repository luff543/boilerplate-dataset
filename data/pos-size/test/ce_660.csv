html body text div div div p span  ,"You could say that Comcast doesn't need TiVo... No one chooses their television service based on the beauty of interface design or how they access their programs. However, moving forward, it's all about keeping up with and/or copying the things that TiVo has introduced to make watching TV that much more of a pleasure. Combined with the fact that as a traditional cable company, Comcast, and others, are behind the eight ball in how they develop and deploy new technology, compared to a traditional consumer electronics company. So in that regard, they do need TiVo... and I guess it's just a matter of time until they take that over as well.",8,5256,759,107,1,8
