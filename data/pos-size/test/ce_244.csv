html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"TF operates an evening school for children. Most of the children comefrom the surrounding areas and go to regular municipal schools. Afterthey are done with the regular schooling, they come to the TF operatedschool. In some cases dropout children are coached for the open schoolexams. The school operates from 5PM to 8PM and uses the premisesone local municipal school called the Dharamdas Trust Model School. TFhas 36 staff including 21 teachers. They run classes for children fromPP (preprimary) to the std XII. There are fewer children in the higherclasses but in the next couple of years, there should be lot more.",50,238,679,125,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"TF has been running a school for children from slums in Kolkata for thepast 10 years. Consistness and completeness is their objective. Theyhave shown considerable innovation w.r.t keeping the childrenmotivated, involving the community, and working with the localgovernment. This visit comes approximately 10 years after they startedand while everything is done as yet, it appears that they are prettysuccessful in their effort to retain and motivate children. It is aninteresting experiment, and throws up many questions regarding the roleof NGOs, government, parents and education.",50,593,666,107,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,There were a couple of folks who came in later from a local college whowere interning with TF.,50,1146,615,17,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"The office has three rooms one each for Mamoni and Ashish. Another forrest of the staff (accounting, cells etc.)",50,1182,682,35,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"I gave an update on the sanctuary conference which happened that sameweek in Mysore, and talked aboutAshis's presentation there.",50,1236,639,35,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"Shortly after I reached office, children started flowing in. They hungaround for some time before going to the evening school run byTomorrow's Foundation at the local Dharamdas School. They recited poemand sang songs for me. While I was therethree girls from the open school (Std X) came back after writing theirhistory exam. They seem satisfied enough with their performance butthey hope to do better in the next couple of exams - one of which isbengali and another is biology. Then I gave a short test ongeography and political map of india.They kept getting confused but made progress. I gave them some simpletips on writing exams.",50,1290,677,125,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,An interesting thing happened: One of the girls wanted to come to US. Iasked why. She replied that she likes to watch WWF and if she comes toUS she can see WWF for real. I tried convincing them that the wholeshow is scripted but they refused to believe it. Later Kasturi di(Counseling) explained to me the significance of WWF. They saw the WWFfights give a vent to aggression building up in them from within.Subtle but unmistakable if you are looking for clues.,50,1434,662,89,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"I left for the school slightly after 5PM. By the time I reached, theprayer was over and children were in their classes. I visited eachclass starting from PP (pre-primary to 12th). In higher classes therewere relatively few students. I met some star candidades whose name Ihad only heard of before. I went into each class and greeted everyone.Children naturally welcomed from the interruption. Some of the classeswere preparing from exams or taking mocks.",50,1542,654,89,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,The PP and Standard I children were particularly excited. The standardI children rushed towards me. Most wanted to shake hands with me andtry their latest technique for that involving the thumb and the littlefinger.Some (embarrasingly) wanted to touch my feet - a local custombeing drilled into their minds.,50,1650,681,53,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"I spent almost 1 hour (one period) with Standard 4. I discussed India'sgeography. They were quite eager to converse about anything andeverything, and asked many questions. They made me sing and one of themalso sang. It was themost fun part of my visit.",50,1722,681,53,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,Just before leaving one small girl gave me greeting card and ran awaybefore I realized. She drew a nice picture of a home with crayons andwrote her name and class at the back. Cool! Apparently thats theresponsibility of Class I.,50,1794,662,53,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,Chanchal dropped me off at Ashish and Tanushree's place. We caught upon the conference happenings.,50,1866,659,17,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,Visit to HWH Site:,50,1986,122,17,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"Day started with a visit to the Half Way Home construction site. (Seethe pictures). The Half Way Home is a temporary shelter for children inneed - there are about 3-4 crisis situations everyweek. There was alsoa need to consolidate TF activities. With support from Asha and others,they bought some land in Kolkata suburbs near Ruby Hospital off a majorhighway. The construction has begun in December. Half Way Home was oneof the benificiaries of the Asha WAH 2003 effort.",50,2022,677,89,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"The Half Way Home has been expanded since the original WAH proposal wasmade - now it is a four storeyed building with animpressive design contributed by an italian. It is about 20-30 min fromthe Goria (Ashish's place) and also from Raash Beharee (where TFoffice is). The construction workers were digging the plot - wet,clayey soil - to lay the foundation. Since the place is away from themainroad (bypass) and there is nothing but a lake behind, it appearsthat the children of half way home can get some space to play outside.Kalighat area is too crowded. There is a worry about malaria becausethe lake has stagnant water - but that may not be a new problem. thereareponds and mosquitos all over the place.",50,2130,680,125,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"Interestingly the local community, after coming to know about theobjective of the place, agitated against the construction. TF usingsome local contacts were able to convince them.",50,2274,669,35,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,Swarup dropped in to meet me. He updated me (along with Ashish andAnitaji) about the finances - how the budget of the HWH has grown andhow they pooling in money to complete it. At a later point in time Italked to Arup who was in Delhi. He talked about how the organizationhas grown and how they are trying to keep it a consistent effort. Iupdated him about the recently held sanctuary conference. I asked aboutthe TF Card project and future plans for them.,50,2364,684,89,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"The TF Card project is a vocational training center for the olderchildren. The products include cards, lamp shades, books etc. Therevenue of this center is around 2 lakhs which is sufficient to breakeven and generate some profit. The main issue seems to (1) the highcost of the raw material - because they buy in small quantities (2) thedemands are seasonal.",50,2472,680,71,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,There is a possibility that Asha can source material from TF - if wecan figure out how to make it happen. The key issue is the costsof transport.,50,2562,672,35,1,9

They were afew solos and a short skit -- all with ease in front of a crowd ofabout 2-300 students. They got a genuine and long applause. One girl inparticular had a truely wonderful voice. I wanted to meet her on Day 3but she was absent. I met her mother, though. She (mother) came to meetTF stafffor some reason.",50,2652,681,89,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,I spent a couple of hours with Kasturi talking about the psychologicalimpact of TF environment on children. She discussed case studies ofvarious children and how they handle them. There are some key skillsrequired for this (1) figuring out when exactly something iswrong with a child. they show up primarily in changed behavior. (2)talking to figure out what exactly the problem is - everything fromadolescence-related issues to problems at home. This sometimes takemultiple sessions - in one case 20 sessions. Kasturi di also handlescareer counseling. There are a couple of tests which atleast to a firstapproximation can tell us about interests about the child. Sometimes anote is passed to the teachers asking them to pay special attention toa particular child and teachers comes back with observations. All theseare documents are maintained in a per-child folder. I got to see a fewbut did not have time to read the notes in detail.,50,2796,680,179,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"Unstable families - domestic violence, drunkard father, broken homes,loss of livelihood - are the key reasons for dropping out. Poormotivation and lack of family interest add to it. Other issues such aspoor documentation (date of birth), lack of proper shelter esp. duringrainy seasons also contribute to the problem.",50,2994,659,71,1,9
html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,There are standard (psychology) tests apparently give reasonably goodhints about the child - interests and mental state.,50,3084,676,35,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"I went along with Ashish and Shiela on a home visit to the surroundingslums. I visited the slums of Sarat Bose andMasjid. The homes in Sarat Bose are small but generally appear to beclean - no stink from open drains. Masjid was more run down. This walkserves multiple purposes (1) to figure out what the issue is withspecific children who have not been turning up at school (2) to urgechildren who get distracted with activity on the street and forgetabout TF school, and (3) to identify children who are not attendingschool. This appears to be quite effective. There were only a couplehouses with absentee children. This trip was short and there didntappear to be any outstanding issues (except with one child who's uncleexpired).",50,3210,672,125,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"I spent more than an hour with standard 6. Pinaki was incharge. He letme spend time. I didnt have much problem with language. Many of thechildrenknew hindi. They like to sing and dance - something that I found theyallwant to do all the time. They talked about many things includingfavorite bollywoodstars. Somewhere in the middle I mentioned about the personal historiesof a public figures. It really got them interested. They couldntbelievethat somebody could start small and do well. They repeatedly asked meif it was true. I then realized how they have built mental limits forthemselves. I gave a pep talk on why it was possible, and theimportance of school and attending classes. One of them confessed aboutdifficulties that she was having with math. Another jumped in andconfessed the same about History. I spent the rest of class giving themtips on classes and tried to motivate them about the various classesthey take.",50,3408,681,161,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"This was undoubtedly the most exciting day for the children - onlycultural activities were scheduled. There were yoga, drawing, singing,dancing and drama classes. The children were free to choose whateverinterests them. The danceclass is the clear winner by a huge margin. Almost everyone wanted tobe in it. The staff was very impressive. I spent most of my time withthe drama class though. Theteacher was quite accomplished, I believe, from National School ofDrama. He has been with TF with more than two years. When I entered hisclass, hewas discussing scenes from Shakespeare's Hamlet and enacting bits andpieces of it.Later his discussed a little bit of Macbeth as well -- all to studentswho arebetween 3 and 8th standards. I read Macbeth when I was in Class 12! Theclass was preparing for the upcomingannual function on Jan 31. I asked him what the story would be. He saidhe does know as yet. He plans to ""share his experiences with thechildren"", and they will come up with something _together_. The finaldrama might be a collage. He expressed confidence in the children'sabilities and creativity. The children apparently have figured out thebasic stage management, lighting and sound principles. I would haveloved to have such a teacher who gives so much room for creativity ofthe children. I left with the comment thatenacting Macbeth, whatever be the length of the piece, in 5th standardcan do wonders to their confidence.",50,3727,678,269,1,9

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"TF's role is encourage a change in mindset of people. Children - createawareness of their rights.

html body text div table tbody tr td span  ,"(b) NGOs have vested interest in sustaining the problem (e.g., acertain number of derived children) because their livelihooddepends on it.
