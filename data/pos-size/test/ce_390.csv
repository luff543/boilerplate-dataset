html body text p span  ,Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered world),8,242,450,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,and how (to what extent) he overcame them.,8,260,285,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a,8,294,422,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study.,8,312,420,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which destroyed",8,330,472,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a,8,348,411,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z,8,366,398,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak,",8,384,431,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes,8,402,451,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand the",8,420,455,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"way to speak, read and write.",8,438,187,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision",8,472,422,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single,8,490,460,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side",8,508,419,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon,8,526,448,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or,8,544,432,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see,8,562,444,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside,8,580,434,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted.",8,598,430,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much",8,616,443,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision.,8,634,370,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were,8,668,403,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged,8,686,438,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual,8,704,382,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist.,8,722,417,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls,8,740,451,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered.,8,758,424,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his,8,792,426,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other objects",8,810,443,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he,8,828,440,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware,8,846,434,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,of the positioning of his body's parts.,8,864,237,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was.,8,882,416,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces.,8,900,373,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back,8,918,430,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his,8,936,411,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible,8,954,451,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For,8,972,443,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all",8,990,435,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,bewildered.,8,1008,75,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going to,8,1042,469,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time,8,1060,417,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because,8,1078,425,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains,8,1096,427,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly.,8,1114,424,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no",8,1148,431,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He,8,1166,399,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts.,8,1184,403,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example,8,1202,444,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was,8,1220,453,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands;,8,1238,442,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed,8,1256,441,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'.,8,1274,287,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how,8,1308,431,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital,8,1326,433,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them.,8,1344,457,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More,8,1362,401,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example,8,1380,452,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his,8,1398,452,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to,8,1416,432,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,reach out and touch things in his room.,8,1434,250,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest,8,1452,426,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria,8,1470,427,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a blindfolded",8,1488,475,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him,8,1506,445,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or",8,1524,435,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't,8,1542,444,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial,8,1560,457,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,orientation.,8,1578,73,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him,8,1612,422,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family",8,1630,414,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the,8,1648,444,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was,8,1666,427,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when,8,1684,435,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't",8,1702,426,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill.",8,1720,430,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not,8,1738,418,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very,8,1756,436,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to",8,1774,371,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,associate words with them but he could only remember these for a couple,8,1792,471,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the",8,1810,448,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few,8,1828,414,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall,8,1846,438,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered,8,1864,425,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each",8,1882,407,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right,8,1900,410,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at,8,1918,392,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of,8,1936,453,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a,8,1954,441,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact",8,1972,427,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,that he couldn't read out of his right eye.,8,1990,258,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find,8,2024,436,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used,8,2042,431,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually,8,2060,416,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to,8,2078,443,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he,8,2096,445,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written.,8,2114,302,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read, that",8,2132,441,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive,8,2150,428,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he,8,2168,408,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any,8,2186,441,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The,8,2204,451,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with,8,2222,437,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a,8,2240,435,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words,8,2258,436,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what",8,2276,433,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,`brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what,8,2294,394,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,`brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short,8,2312,426,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,sentences.,8,2330,65,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years,8,2364,435,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or,8,2382,418,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He,8,2400,413,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently,8,2418,457,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his,8,2436,446,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every,8,2454,437,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing,8,2472,449,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what,8,2490,454,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he",8,2508,430,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on",8,2526,418,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer towards",8,2544,437,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,the end of his journal.,8,2562,140,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of,8,2596,419,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even",8,2614,444,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be,8,2632,471,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue.",8,2650,418,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely,8,2668,436,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be,8,2686,413,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example,",8,2704,439,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory",8,2722,457,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the,8,2740,414,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,rest of his world.,8,2758,108,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying",8,2792,425,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him,8,2810,445,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and,8,2828,431,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He,8,2846,465,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as,8,2864,461,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some",8,2882,450,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd forget,8,2900,440,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness.,8,2918,431,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things he,8,2952,484,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember,8,2970,445,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The,8,2988,429,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he,8,3006,428,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent",8,3024,456,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories,8,3042,459,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as,8,3060,445,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He,8,3078,432,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately,8,3096,445,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,recognised them.,8,3114,109,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been",8,3148,433,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd,8,3166,437,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well,8,3184,441,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone.,8,3202,400,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count",8,3220,442,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you,8,3238,453,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in",8,3256,440,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,a way that a young child would.,8,3274,205,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his",8,3308,428,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral,8,3326,451,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made,8,3344,442,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still annoy,8,3362,442,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space'",8,3380,403,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home,8,3398,446,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,settlement.,8,3416,70,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how",8,3450,458,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you",8,3468,422,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at the,8,3486,447,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort,8,3504,422,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,"to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved.",8,3522,465,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered,8,3540,437,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really,8,3558,403,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to,8,3576,428,17,1,5
html body text p span  ,improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life,8,3594,425,17,1,5
