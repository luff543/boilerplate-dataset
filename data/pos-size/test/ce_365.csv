html body text ul font p span  ,"Nice definition. One comment on the comments. In the definition #1 you talk of responsible use vs misuse, yet in the comments you talk of benefits and destructiveness. In what way does the lack of heroin's benefits preclude the possibility of its being used responsibly? (note: I am not saying that I know any 'responsible' heroin addicts. I don't, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.) The medical benefits of alcohol or pot certainly don't preclude them from being used irresponsibly. Is it possible to use tobacco responsibly?",48,1180,725,89,1,7

html body text ul font p span  ,You raise valid objections. My terminology and discussion of the examples was arbitrary and oversimplified.,48,1532,698,17,1,7
html body text ul font p span  ,"When talking about ""misuse"" and ""responsible use"", I had in mind impact on society (eg with gun ownership).

html body text ul font p span  ,"Tobacco-- Yes, it is often used ""responsibly"" to raise work productivity. For example, a friend of mine was a naval officer. Whenever he went to sea, with the usual schedule that only allows about 3 hours of sleep per day, he would take up smoking as the best way to avoid falling asleep at the job. Whenever his tour of sea duty ended, however, he would quit when he came home to his family, all non-smokers.",48,1776,726,71,1,7

Heroin is an extremely potent cough suppressant and also an extremely potent pain reliever.
