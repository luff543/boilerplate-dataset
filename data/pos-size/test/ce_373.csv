html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Following informal consultations initiated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT)'s Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and Disarmament Division, a Steering Group of NGO, academic and government representatives was formed in November 1999 to set dates, draft an agenda and generate a list of participants for the inaugural round of these annual consultations. Members of the Steering Group include David Dewitt (York University), Albert Legault (Université Laval), Brian Job (UBC), Dr. Jennifer Simons (Simons Foundation), Ernie Regehr (Project Ploughshares) and Debbie Grisdale (Physicians for Global Survival), as well as representatives from DFAIT and the Department of National Defence (DND).",158,627,447,215,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Steering Group (SG) agreed that it would be best to have small-scale and focussed consultations. It was recognized that a group of this limited size would facilitate a free and frank exchange of ideas in a single plenary format. Accordingly, on the basis of the SG's recommendations, invitations were issued to (and accepted by) twenty academic and NGO representatives, making for a total (with government representatives) of approximately thirty participants (see Appendix). The consultations were held at the Government Conference Centre in Ottawa on 3-4 February 2000.",158,859,445,161,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The format of the consultations combined thematic and fora/topical approaches, with Day One focussed thematically on broad nuclear issues (disarmament, non-proliferation, the international security context) and Day Two focussed on specific fora and issues (the NPT, NATO, ballistic missiles, verification and control mechanisms). The Honourable Bill Graham, the chairman of SCFAIT, addressed participants at lunch on the first day; later that same day the Honourable Lloyd Axworthy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, participated in a roundtable discussion.",158,1037,441,161,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p strong span  ,Introduction,158,1375,87,17,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,The opening session touched briefly on the main issues at stake and on participants' expectations of what these Consultations might accomplish.,158,1409,433,53,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"It was noted that the substantive focus of the two-day session could be characterized as a "" promise unfulfilled"" : what had drawn the participants together was the fact that, ten years after the end of the conflict that spawned the most lethal arsenals humankind had ever known, progress on reducing those arsenals was effectively stalled. Indeed, far from looking forward to a post-Cold War world free of nuclear weapons, we found ourselves in a situation where some military planners were dreaming up new missions for nuclear weapons, would-be proliferators had carried out nuclear tests, and some of the non-nuclear-weapon states who had renounced nuclear weapons were having second thoughts.",158,1479,431,197,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Why hold consultations? Policy making could benefit from dialogue between interested individuals within and outside government. More importantly, it was recognized that in an era of ever-diminishing resources, all those with an active stake in nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament issues - whether government, academics, NGOs or concerned individuals - needed to support one another and work together. This was especially relevant for a country like Canada, whose international reach often tended to exceed its increasingly constrained grasp. Choices had to be made and limited resources had to be pooled and leveraged effectively; a good consultative process was essential.",158,1693,443,197,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Following these introductory remarks, there was a motion from the floor to suggest that the title of the consultations be modified to reflect the fact that not all nuclear-related issues - for example, nuclear energy - would be covered during the two-day session. It was agreed that the meeting would be re-titled "" Government Consultations with Civil Society on Selected Nuclear Issues"" .",158,1907,444,107,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p strong span  ,Session I: The International Security Context,158,2031,310,17,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"A prominent theme was the degree to which Canada - by virtue of its membership in NATO and association with that Alliance's nuclear policy, actions in Kosovo and what some view as a "" provocative"" expansion to the East - was itself contributing to an international environment which made others feel less secure. Several participants attributed recent disquieting trends in Russian behaviour - above all, the dramatic lowering of the nuclear threshold in Moscow'snew military doctrine - to Russia's perceived need to compensate for the "" humiliation"" NATO had dealt it over Kosovo.",158,2065,442,161,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Russia, it was observed by some speakers, remained a crucial actor on the international scene and a major challenge because of its desire to command the respect and influence of bygone superpower days without the real clout to demand it. Engaging Russia was crucial to global stability, yet a number of speakers feared that the "" window of opportunity"" opened by the end of the Cold War had been missed.",158,2243,449,107,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Some participants asserted a growing gap between the internationalist norms that have traditionally underpinned Canada's conception of a just and stable world order and the "" unilateralism"" practised by our closest neighbour and ally. One speaker asserted that, whether one liked it or not, Canada's security during the Cold War era was founded on Western deterrence, hence our alliance with the USA, but that today, US policies - such as the pursuit of National Missile Defence and the Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty - were contributing to a less stable international environment that was not in Canada's security interests.",158,2367,450,179,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Some suggested that Canada had nothing to lose and much to gain by acting together with like-minded countries independently of the US, with a number of participants arguing forcefully in this regard that, where nuclear weapons were concerned, Canada ought to adopt "" a pure and simple abolition policy."" Others noted that Canada's ability to distance itself from US positions appeared to be determined in an entirely "" arbitrary"" manner, suggesting the need for greater transparency in the process by which the government established how far a given security interest could be distanced from the range of other Canadian interests with the USA.",158,2563,450,179,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Asia was flagged as the region that represented the greatest danger of a conflict either involving nuclear weapons (eg. India-Pakistan) or threatening to draw in nuclear weapon states (NWS) (eg. China-Taiwan). Here again the perils of US "" unilateralism"" were argued by some participants, with one underlining how US pursuit of Theatre Missile Defence (TMD) in the region was viewed by China as a direct threat to its fundamental national interests. Another speaker mused about the potential for "" de-coupling"" between the Asian regional and the larger international security systems, wondering out loud whether we in the West had any idea what we would do if the India-Pakistan conflict in fact went nuclear: would we help to clean up? Would we have the capacity to do so?",158,2759,450,215,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"On the question of broader approaches to security, it was argued by one speaker that the Canadian peace movement had always favoured a holistic approach that underlined how factors such as environmental degradation and inadequate development assistance contributed to insecurity; when dealing with the security challenges posed, for example, by the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK), "" more than their missiles"" needed to be addressed. Canada's "" human security"" agenda was a step in the right direction but could not, others asserted, be considered a success so long as Canada continued to export military goods to states violating human rights or undermining human security and kept its international development assistance at unacceptably low levels.",158,2991,447,215,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The issue of "" double standards"" came up repeatedly. A number of participants wondered why Kosovo and East Timor were deemed worthy of "" humanitarian intervention"" while other long-suffering regions were not. The point was made in reply that just because the international community was incapable of intervening everywhere did not mean it should intervene nowhere; Canada had to do what it could under the circumstances.",158,3223,449,125,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Condemnation of India's and Pakistan's nuclear ambitions was also deemed by some to be hypocritical: how could these two countries be told to renounce nuclear weapons when the five NWS had not done so and when the Alliance of which Canada was a member embraced them? It was argued in reply that while a contradiction might exist, it diminished when one factored in the element of time, that is, the fact that all parties to the NPT were committed to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. The NPT could be seen as discriminatory in that it permitted the five NWS a status denied all others, yet the fact that 187 states had agreed to accept this state of affairs in order to enjoy the broader benefits of the regime suggested that the flaw was not fatal. It was suggested that to accept India and Pakistan's arguments was to adopt an "" NRA approach"" to arms control, i.e. to advocate that "" everyone"" should have nuclear weapons.",158,3365,447,251,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p strong span  ,Luncheon Address by the Honourable Bill Graham,158,3633,349,17,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Honourable Bill Graham, chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, delivered a luncheon address which drew its title from the December 1998 SCFAIT Report, "" Reducing the Political Value of Nuclear Weapons.""",158,3667,449,71,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Mr. Graham contended that the current strains on the NPT regime - from the South Asia nuclear tests to the lack of progress on START - served to reinforce the central message of the SCFAIT Report: that the major challenge of nuclear weapons, in addition to preventing their further proliferation by strengthening the NPT regime, was to work to reduce their perceived political value in order to contribute to the goal of their progressive reduction and eventual elimination.Minister Axworthy's initial request that SCFAIT undertake the study that led to the December 1998 Report, Mr. Graham suggested, was testimony to the energy and engagement of the NGOs represented at these first annual Consultations. The Consultations themselves, Mr. Graham noted, were a welcome outcome of the SCFAIT Report.",158,3755,447,233,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Some had been disappointed, Mr. Graham recalled, by the SCFAIT Report's failure to recommend that NATO adopt a policy of No First Use of nuclear weapons. Mr. Graham held that while it had been appropriate for SCFAIT to urge that NATO review its nuclear weapons policy to take into account dramatic changes in the post-Cold War security environment, it had not been the Committee's place to tell NATO what conclusions to reach. Mr. Graham welcomed the commitment to a policy review agreed at the NATO Ministerial in December 1999, and suggested that hard lobbying by Canadian M.P.s of their NATO country counterparts at the earlier Istanbul Summit had helped pave the way for this outcome.",158,4005,449,197,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"There was a lesson here for participants in the Consultations, he continued. Canadian NGOs should maintain close contacts with NGOs in other countries and get them to press their politicians the way Mr. Graham and his colleagues had pressed in Istanbul. The US was key, given its unique ability to lead on disarmament questions from a position of strength; unfortunately these questions tended to play in a manner that put the US against everyone else, with the failure of the CTBT a case in point.",158,4219,438,143,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"What was needed was to engage the Americans in a different way, to show them how action to strengthen the NPT regime would be in their own best interest. US opinion, Mr. Graham recalled, was not monolithic. The CTBT was voted down in the US Senate for purely partisan reasons, not on its merits. Many of Mr. Graham's American counterparts were still wrestling with these issues; we were not without allies south of the border. Mr. Graham looked forward to continuing to promote support for the NPT at the next meeting of the Canada-US Parliamentary Group in May 2000, and whenever else the occasion rose to doso.",158,4379,448,179,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"During the question and answer session that followed Mr. Graham's remarks, one speaker lamented the fact that NACD issues ranked so low among the US public's concerns, and suggested that this in effect freed Congress to act however it saw fit on such important issues as the CTBT and NMD. Another questioner pointed out that, according to polls, popular American support for the U.N. is higher than support either for Congress or for NATO. Mr. Graham noted that Members of Congress still play a key role and it was our job to try to help to push them in the right direction.",158,4575,447,161,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p strong span  ,Session II: Nuclear Disarmament,158,4753,227,17,1,14
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"While many participants characterized the current state of nuclear disarmament efforts as one of "" crisis"" , views were not unanimous in this regard. One speaker suggested that the failure to achieve reform of the UN Security Council was more worrisome than the rate of progress on Article VI of the NPT. That said, the main elements of the "" crisis"" perspective received a thorough airing.",158,4787,448,107,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,The United States Senate's failure to ratify the CTBT - which represented decades of work - was singled out by many speakers as a particularly hard blow to the disarmament cause. The doubts about verifiability that had helped to sink the Treaty were seen as a further manifestation of a growing distrust of multilateralism in the US.,158,4911,443,89,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"But the problems went well beyond the US. The West as a whole, it was suggested, was not pulling its weight to give Russia the financial assistance it needed to carry out arms control commitments made since the end of the Cold War. The continued attraction of nuclear deterrence was a major factor in the view of some participants; whether justified or not, countries such as India and Israel felt safer with nuclear weapons than without. Prestige - the perception thatpossessing nuclear weapons gave you a place "" at the high table"" of international politics - played a role as well.",158,5017,444,161,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"On the way ahead, it was proposed that Canada simultaneously pursue incremental approaches and outright abolition, on the grounds that incrementalism on its own was pointless without a clear sense of the final destination, but also that it was important not to force others to choose between the two because this would simply lose Canada allies. It was also argued that there was something to be said for measured - as opposed to "" speedy"" - progress, in the sense that theexisting infrastructure for dismantling weapons was already going full tilt and that plutonium poorly secured in a warehouse might be more dangerous than plutonium remaining in a warhead.",158,5195,444,179,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"This view was countered by a vigorous appeal from other speakers for Canada to adopt the more ambitious approach of the "" New Agenda"" Coalition (NAC), specifically the NAC's call on the NWS to undertake an "" unequivocal commitment"" to accomplish the "" speedy and total elimination"" of their nuclear arsenals "" without delay."" Canada, these speakers argued, was already well down this road; the fact that it had abstained on the "" New Agenda"" resolution at the past two UN General Assemblies should not prevent Canada from working with the NAC to achieve the "" unequivocal commitment"" it sought. According to this view, the positions Canada had adopted at the last NPT Preparatory Committee, while praiseworthy, fell short of what was required to meet the current "" crisis"" . NAC representatives were reportedly putting out the word that adoption of an "" unequivocal commitment"" to disarmament along the lines of their UNGA resolutions was the "" minimum"" requirement for a successful NPT Review Conference this spring.",158,5391,447,287,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"On the implications of such a move for our relations with the United States, one participant suggested that many American officials would welcome Canada's full endorsement of the NAC platform as a way to help them press US decision-makers to take stronger action on disarmament. The broader issue of how best to reinforce those American constituencies which favour disarmament was also addressed. One participant underlined the need for a "" two-pronged strategy"" of engaging both the government and NGOs, it being most important, in the US context, that lobbying for a more forthcoming policy on NACD issues be seen to be domestically generated rather than a result of outside pressures. Another speaker lamented the general lack of US awareness of these issues,rooted, this speaker suggested, in the fact that most Americans read",158,5695,444,233,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The problem of apathy - the fact that the general public seemed to have forgotten the danger of nuclear weapons following the end of the Cold War - was discussed at some length. It was noted that while biological and chemical weapons are seen as abhorrent, the same standard did not seem to apply to nuclear weapons. The nuclear disarmament drive's loss of steam could be attributed in part to post-Cold War developments: the prospect of nuclear annihilation not only seemed increasingly remote, but had also understandably paled in a world that had witnessed mass murder with machetes and the re-appearance of concentration camps in Europe.",158,5963,450,179,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Engaging youth was underlined as a key imperative, with one participant proposing a "" youth Prep Com"" in the run-up to the NPT Review Conference as one way to educate the younger generation on the issues at stake. As far as the contribution NGOs could make to raising awareness among youth and the broader public, severe financial constraints were flagged as the major limiting factor. At the diplomatic level, it was noted that the current deadlock in the Committee on Disarmament (CD) inhibited substantive discussion of important NACD issues even among officials; this suggested a need to think creatively about ways to break the logjam, for example by forging new coalitions (on the NAC example) to put the outdated groupings of the Cold War behind us.",158,6159,443,215,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Picking up on a number of themes raised earlier in the day's discussions, this session focussed on the causes of nuclear proliferation and on the practical steps Canada could or should be taking to combat it. As the world's largest exporter of uranium, one speaker argued, Canada had a special responsibility to be active in this area.",158,6425,429,107,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"A short historical overview of proliferation was offered to counter the impression that the problem had emerged only in recent years. India's nuclear capability dated back to 1974, one speaker noted and linked this development to fissile material derived (illicitly) from a Canadian-supplied research reactor. Pakistan had reportedly been nuclear capable since the late 1980s, others noted; Israel's unacknowledged nuclear weapons program appeared to date to the early 1970s; and the DPRK and Iraq's nuclear aspirations had been known for some time.",158,6549,446,161,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Why go nuclear? Several categories of incentives were identified: conflictual relationship with a NWS; desire for "" great power"" status; the quest for regional hegemony; or, in the case of "" rogue"" states, a desire to make great powers think twice about intervening. As to the reverse - why some states had given up the nuclear option - it was suggested that the overriding factor was a significant lessening or elimination of the enduring rivalry with another state that hadtriggered pursuit of the option in the first place.",158,6727,442,143,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In this regard, one participant suggested that the "" high moral ground"" Canada had adopted with respect to India and Pakistan was not that effective. The two countries' decision to test nuclear devices could be seen as a response to genuine security concerns, it was argued, in which case Canada would be better off to engage them in ways that might see these concerns addressed.",158,6887,448,107,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Several speakers noted that another lesson taught by the South Asia nuclear tests was that it was impossible to have non-proliferation without disarmament: the NWS's continued attachment to their arsenals offered India and Pakistan a rich source of justification. It did not follow, however, that the 1995 indefinite extension of the NPT had been a mistake; the argument was forcefully made that the world was much better off with an indefinitely extended NPT than it would have been without it.",158,7011,449,143,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Several recommendations were made with respect to Canadian policy, most premised on the argument that Canada should distance itself from the US and seek coalitions of more like-minded multilateralists. With respect to NATO's current review of policy options on verification, confidence and security building measures, non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament, for example, some participants urged Canada to do more by "" divorcing"" itself from the Alliance'snuclear policies and pushing for a policy of No First Use by all NWS. It was also suggested that Canada support calls to amend the NPT to specify a timetable for disarmament under Article VI; indefinite extension, it was argued, should not mean indefinite possession of nuclear weapons by the NWS. The government was encouraged to hold a conference to support a Nuclear Weapons Convention, as well as to throw its support unreservedly behind the New Agenda Coalition.",158,7171,449,269,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"One speaker's remark to the effect that nuclear disarmament was a critical precondition for enjoying the positive benefits of nuclear power launched a vigorous discussion of Canadian nuclear energy policy. One participant called for separate consultations devoted exclusively to nuclear energy issues, including government policy on plutonium and the export of uranium. The central argument was that Canada's non-proliferation efforts had no credibility given ouralleged failure to oppose the use and stock-piling of plutonium. Assurances were offered that Canadian policy in this sphere was entirely consistent with our NPT obligations, that all separated plutonium was under IAEA safeguards and all evidence suggested that this non-proliferation regime was working exceedingly well.",158,7457,446,215,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Minister Axworthy was briefed at the outset on the principal themes that had emerged during the three preceding sessions. The core issue, it was suggested, was a genuine concern about Canada's place in the nuclear world, and about whether we were pursuing the best policies possible. There appeared to be a contradiction between Canada's strong support for the NPT and our consistent rejection of nuclear weapons, on the one hand, and our continued membership in an Alliance that embraced them. The concerns that had been expressed about US unilateralism were summarized, in particular how Canada's close relations with the US were perceived to constrain our ability to be as forceful on nuclear NACD issues as we might otherwise be. We were perhaps missing opportunities to build coalitions with other countries and with those who shared our views in the US itself; Canada should be promoting the benefits of multilateralism more aggressively. It was also important to challenge the logic that attracted states to the nuclear option, in part by addressing such states' underlying security concerns.",158,7723,450,305,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Minister observed that at times it was tough to find "" like-minded"" allies on nuclear issues.

Others suggested that Canada's traditional non-nuclear-weapon state (NNWS) allies could not be expected to take up the charge; all were suffering "" fatigue"" related to their own domestic and European political developments. The broader political context was seen by one speaker as unfavourable, given difficulties with the Russians over Kosovo and now Chechnya, compounded by Moscow's differences with Washington over the possible deployment of a National Missile Defense (NMD) system.

Canada had in fact proposed such a Treaty in the mid-1990s but met with stiff resistance and dropped the idea. This did not preclude progress in the form of smaller steps, however. There were a number of avenues worth pursuing in this regard, from confidence and "" norm-building"" measures such as launch notification agreements to efforts to engage potential missile proliferators who were outside the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).",158,13822,444,251,1,13

Byseeking a technological "" fix"" to the alleged challenge posed by "" rogue"" states, one participant suggested, Washington was overlooking alternative solutions: the $10 billion ear-marked for NMD could be better spent to promote democratization through aid and engagement.",158,14090,449,197,1,13

Their likely response - MIRVing the new Topol-M in the case of Russia, an acceleration of long-range missile development programs (possibly in cooperation with Moscow) in the case of China - could, it was suggested, initiate a classic arms spiral resulting in diminished security for all. The implications for regionalsecurity in Asia were especially disturbing - Japan, for example, might face increased pressures to "" go nuclear"" to counter China's growing ICBM force - yet while Washington was working hard to engage Russia on NMD, China was receiving far less attention.",158,14304,448,341,1,13

Arguing against such defensive odds would be a tough sell to theaverage American. The peace movement, it was argued, was against NMD because it was de-stabilizing, but this did not imply a preference for deterrence.

When speaking of UNSCOM's successor - UNMOVIC (UN Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission) - the suggestion was made that it might enjoy a closer relationship with IAEA than UNSCOM did, owing to the recent appointment of the former head of IAEA as Executive Chair of UNMOVIC. It was acknowledged by many participants, however, that Iraq's failure to fulfil all its obligations as a party to the NPT had been and remained a significant challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime.

As a member of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Canada was working to strengthen export controls and encourage greater transparency in their application.

Effective controls facilitated peaceful uses of atomic energy, one speaker argued, and every grain of exported Canadian uranium was safeguarded and monitored. While Canada did not reprocess uranium, many countries did so for reasons of cost and limiting waste; the plutonium produced as a result was turned into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and burned again, under full safeguards. Canada's agreement to consider the use of mixed oxide fuel containing US and Russian excess-weapons plutonium in CANDU reactors reflected its commitment to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium under IAEA safeguards and therefore contribute to the progressive reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.",158,16426,448,305,1,13
