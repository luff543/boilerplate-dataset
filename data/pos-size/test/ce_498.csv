html body text table tbody tr td font font p i span  ,NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY,3,175,173,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Few industries in the United States have changed as rapidly in recent years as the steel industry. As a result of new investment in equipment and worker training, this industry has gone from a seemingly moribund one, to one that leads the world in worker productivity and is the low cost producer for some types of steel. The U.S. steel industry still faces stiff competition, and employment is expected to continue to decline; but it is now in a more promising position to meet these challenges.",3,203,538,90,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"With new investments have come fundamental changes in the nature of this industry. The most significant change in the American steel industry is the development of the electric arc furnace (EAF), sometimes called the ""minimill"", which converts scrap metal from many sources-such as bridges, refrigerators, and automobiles-to steel. The term ""minimill"" originated from the relatively smaller size of these mills when they first appeared, compared with traditional integrated mills. Today, many EAF's or minimills are actually larger than integrated mills producing steel from raw materials. The smaller capital outlay required to start and operate an EAF has helped drive its growth. Moreover, scrap metal is found in all parts of the country, so EAF's are not tied as closely to raw material deposits as integrated mills and can locate closer to consumers. EAF's now comprise almost half of American steel production and their share is expected to continue to grow in coming years.",3,306,543,165,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"The growth of EAF's comes partly at the expense of integrated mills. Integrated mills produce iron in blast furnaces, from coal, iron ore, and limestone. The iron is then refined into steel, most commonly in basic oxygen furnaces. The steel produced by integrated mills generally is considered to be of higher quality than steel from EAF's, but because more steps are involved in the production process, it also is more costly. The initial step in the integrated mill process is to prepare coal for use in a blast furnace by converting it to coke. Coal is heated in coke ovens to remove impurities and to reduce it to nearly pure carbon. Because coke production is considered to be one of the dirtiest steps in production, many firms are looking for substitutes for coke in steelmaking.",3,484,543,135,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"At the other end of the steel manufacturing process, semifinished steel from either EAF's or integrated mills is converted into finished products. Some of the goods produced in finishing mills are steel wire, pipe, bars, rods, and sheets. Products also may be coated with chemicals, paints, or other metals that give the steel desired characteristics for various industries and consumers. Also involved in steel manufacturing are firms that produce alloys, by adding materials like silicon and manganese to the steel. Varying the amounts of carbon and other elements contained in the final product can produce thousands of different types of steel, each with specific properties suited for a particular use.",3,632,542,120,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Increasing competition from abroad and in the domestic market has caused integrated and EAF producers to modernize. For workers, this often has meant learning new skills to operate sophisticated equipment. Competition also has resulted in increasing specialization of steel production, as various producers attempt to capture different niches in the market. With these changes has come a growing emphasis on flexibility and adaptability for both workers and equipment. As international and domestic competition mounts for U.S. steel producers, the nature of the industry is expected to continue to change in these directions.",3,765,537,105,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p i span  ,WORKING CONDITIONS,3,883,149,15,1,12
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Steel mills evoke images of strenuous, hot, and potentially dangerous work. While many dangerous and difficult jobs remain in the steel industry, modern equipment and facilities have helped to change this. The most strenuous tasks were among the first to be automated. For example, computer-controlled machinery helps to monitor and move iron and steel through the production processes, reducing the need for heavy labor. In some cases, workers now monitor and control the equipment from air-conditioned rooms.",3,911,543,90,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Nevertheless, large machinery and molten metal can be hazardous, unless safety procedures are observed. Hard hats, safety shoes, protective glasses, ear plugs, and protective clothing are required in most production areas.",3,1014,538,45,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"The expense of plant and machinery and significant production startup costs force most mills to operate around the clock. Workers averaged 44.6 hours per week in 1998, and only about 1.7 percent of workers are employed part time. Night and weekend shifts are common, as is overtime work during peak production periods. In 1998, 33.7 percent of all steel workers put in overtime.",3,1072,540,75,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Cases of occupational injury and illness in the industry were 12.0 per 100 full-time workers in 1997, significantly higher than the 7.1 cases per 100 workers for the entire private sector and also higher than the 10.3 cases per 100 for all manufacturing.

html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Employment in the steel industry declined to about 232,000 wage and salary jobs in 1998, less than half its 1980 level. The rate of decline, however, has slowed in recent years. The steel industry traditionally has been located in the eastern and Midwestern regions of the country, where iron ore, coal, or one of the other natural resources required for steel are found. Even today, about 50 percent of all steelworkers are employed in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. The growth of EAF's, though, has allowed steel-making to spread to virtually all parts of the country. Large firms employ most workers in the steel industry. Over 9 out of 10 work in establishments employing at least 50 workers, and almost half work in establishments employing 1,000 or more persons (chart 1).",3,1261,543,135,1,11

Blowers are responsible for the quality and quantity of the iron produced and for supervising keepers and their helpers. Keepers operate the equipment used to tap the liquid iron and to remove impurities from the furnace. The molten iron then is ready to be transformed into steel.",3,3402,539,105,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Generally, either a basic oxygen or an electric arc furnace is used to make steel. Although the steel making procedure varies with the type of furnace used, the jobs associated with the various processes are similar. Melters supervise furnace operators and their assistants who control the furnace. Melters gather information on the characteristics of the raw materials they will use and the type and quality of steel they are expected to produce. They direct the loading of the furnace with raw materials and supervise the taking of samples, to insure that the steel has the desired qualities. Melters also coordinate the loading and melting of raw materials with the steel molding or casting operation to avoid delays in production.",3,3520,542,120,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Furnace operators use controls to tilt the furnace to receive the raw materials. Once they have righted the furnace, furnace operators use levers and buttons to control the flow of oxygen and other materials into the furnace. During the production process, assistants routinely take samples to be analyzed. Based on this analysis, operators determine how much longer they must process the steel or what materials they must add to meet specifications. Operators also pay close attention to conditions within the furnace and correct any problems that arise during the production process.",3,3653,543,105,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"Traditionally, liquid steel was moved from the furnaces into a ladle from which it was poured into ingots. Steel producers now use a process known as ""continuous casting"" almost exclusively. Continuous casting allows firms to produce steel ready for the next step in processing directly from liquid steel, thus eliminating many of the steps involved in pouring and rolling ingots. Molding and casting machine operators tend machines that release the molten steel from the ladle into water-cooled molds at a controlled rate. Molded steel is then cut to desired lengths, as it emerges from the rolls. During this process, operators monitor the flow of raw steel and the supply of water to the mold.",3,3771,543,120,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td font font p span  ,"The ""rolling"" method shapes most steel processed in steel mills. In this method, hot steel is squeezed between two cylinders or ""rollers,"" which flatten or shape the steel. Heaters monitor equipment that tells when the ingot is uniformly heated to the required temperature. Rollers operate equipment that rolls the steel ingots into semifinished product; the quality of the product and the speed at which the ingot is rolled depend on the roller's skills. Manipulator operators tend the machinery, which controls the position of the ingot on the roller. Placing the ingot and positioning the rollers are very important, for they control the product's final shape. Improperly adjusted equipment may damage the rollers or gears.",3,3904,539,120,1,11

New workers entering the production process as lower-skilled laborers generally assist more experienced workers, beginning with relatively simple tasks. As workers acquire experience, they specialize in a particular process and acquire greater skill in that area. They may progress from second helper to first helper, and then to a skilled position, such as melter or roller. The time required to become a skilled worker depends upon individual abilities, acquired skills, and available job openings. It generally takes at least 4 or 5 years, and sometimes much longer, to advance to a skilled position. At times, workers change their specialization to increase their opportunities for advancement.

Many American steel producers, however, complain that they face unfair competition from abroad and that foreign producers, subsidized by their governments, are ""dumping"" steel in the U.S. market. Efforts currently are underway to improve trade relations in steel. If these efforts are successful, increasing trade would almost certainly result, which would foster growth in the most efficient American firms as they take advantages of growing export opportunities.

Computerized systems change the nature of many jobs, while they eliminate or reduce the demand for others. For example, computers allow one worker to perform duties that previously took the efforts of several workers. However, computer-controlled equipment often requires operators to have greater skills. Hence, workers who are comfortable with computers and other high-tech equipment-as well as those willing and able to learn-will be more widely sought after by employers.

Growth of EAF's is driven by many factors, including relatively low startup costs, flexibility, and the ability to locate close to the consumer. This is especially important in the construction industry. Because the scrap steel they need to operate is widely available, EAF's have provided job opportunities in the steel industry in additional geographic areas.
