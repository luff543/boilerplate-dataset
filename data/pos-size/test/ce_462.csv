html body text p span  ,"The wording here was careless. Theintention was that nobody would have to pay for *permission* to usethe GNU system. But the words don't make this clear, and people ofteninterpret them as saying that copies of GNU should always bedistributed at little or no charge. That was never the intent; lateron, the manifesto mentions the possibility of companies providing theservice of distribution for a profit. Subsequently I have learned todistinguish carefully between ""free"" in the sense of freedom and""free"" in the sense of price. Free software is software that usershave the freedom to distribute and change. Some users may obtaincopies at no charge, while others pay to obtain copies--and if thefunds help support improving the software, so much the better. Theimportant thing is that everyone who has a copy has the freedom tocooperate with others in using it.",8,6114,766,143,1,5

html body text p span  ,"In the 80s I had not yet realized how confusing it was to speak of""the issue"" of ""intellectual property"". That term is obviouslybiased; more subtle is the fact that it lumps together variousdisparate laws which raise very different issues. Nowadays I urgepeople to reject the term ""intellectual property"" entirely, lest itlead others to suppose that those laws form one coherent issue. Theway to be clear is to discuss patents, copyrights, and trademarksseparately. See",8,6464,756,71,1,5
