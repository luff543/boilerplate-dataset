html body text table tbody tr td p font strong span  ,"Oswestry is an ancient market town located in the North of Shropshire close by the English - Welsh Border. Its strategic position as a 'frontier town' has given it a turbulent history. Today the town still retains its vital function as a market and shopping centre serving North West Shropshire and Mid Wales. The narrow passageways link streets whose names conjure up images of the past: English Walls, Welsh Walls, The Bailey and the Horsemarket. It is a locally important shopping and agricultural centre and still retains the intimacy of a rural town serving local people and home to a number of specialist and independent shops.",11,205,363,180,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p font strong span  ,The origins of the town are uncertain although the towns market dates back to 1190. The name Oswestry is thought to be a corruption of 'Oswald's Tree' and the legend that Oswald the Christian King of Northumbria fought a great battle against the pagan King of Mercia - Penda. Oswald was defeated and killed in the battle. Penda - as a warning to others who might challenge his rule - dismembered Oswald's body and hung his limbs on the branches of a tree - hence the name 'Oswalds Tree'.,11,400,579,120,1,11

html body text table tbody tr td p font strong span  ,Post 1835 Oswestry saw was a period of great development. In the late 1840’s new Markets were built in the late 1840's and the construction of reservoirs followed from the late 1860's to the late 1880's.

html body text table tbody tr td p font strong span  ,"The earliest reference to the town was recorded 1272 and the settlement of Blancminster, which derives from its white stone church. The Welsh refer to a ‘Creos Oswallt’ in 1254, and an obvious link with St. Oswald, the Northumbrian King who was killed at the nearby Battle of Maeserfelth in 641 AD. Regardless, it is generally accepted that Oswestry was once a strong Welsh settlement and the Castle had a role of domination to subdue Welsh resistance.",11,1060,763,60,1,11
html body text table tbody tr td p font strong span  ,"Following the conquest, the region was granted to Roger de Montgomerie by William I.

html body text table tbody tr td p font strong span  ,"The outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 revived its status as a military stronghold and it was once more strengthened to some degree, following the town’s declaration of support for Charles I, and prepared for hostility. In June 1644 the castle was under the control of Colonel Edward Lloyd of Llanforda. It was laid to siege by Thomas Mytton of Halston Hall (near Whittington) who was soon joined by the earl of Denbigh. The town gates were battered into submission by cannon and infiltrated by troops who rapidly descended upon the castle, surrounding. The following day, ‘Buttars,’ a kind of early grenade, were used to storm the gates and the royalist troops surrendered.",11,1450,763,90,1,11
