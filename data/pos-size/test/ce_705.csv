html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,Why do the coal and nuclear industries love hydrogen?,202,397,353,17,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"All of a sudden, hydrogen is the hottest atom on the periodic table. When compressed into fuel cells, the element works like a battery that can power everything from cars to spaceships, while producing no waste—just drinkable water. Alternative-energy guru Amory Lovins is a fan, as is National Mining Association president Jack Gerard. Other enthusiasts are politicians looking to establish green credentials without irritating the automotive and energy lobbies.",202,431,372,161,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"First on the bandwagon was President George W. Bush, who announced last year that his administration is investing $1.7 billion over five years to develop hydrogen fuel-cell technology for automobiles. Then California’s newly elected governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, vowed to sign an executive order requiring hydrogen fueling stations every 20 miles on the state’s highways. Schwarzenegger, who popularized the gas-guzzling military Humvee as a trophy car for civilians, has said he will convert one of his five Hummers to run on hydrogen, a $35,000 upgrade.",202,609,371,197,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Schwarzenegger’s hydrogen fueling stations would cost up to half a million dollars each, which seems a bit pricey when you consider that his converted Hummer will be about the only vehicle using them. There are no hydrogen-powered cars in the showrooms now, and Bush’s fuel-cell program doesn’t give auto manufacturers any deadlines for producing one. The few prototypes on the road cost several million dollars, and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences said that fuel-cell cars are still decades away.",202,823,378,179,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"There’s also the small matter of producing the hydrogen, which doesn’t occur in its pure form on Earth. One option is to split hydrogen from water using electricity, but unless the electricity comes from a renewable source like wind or solar, this method could end up increasing greenhouse-gas emissions. The Bush administration, ever eager to prop up the coal, oil, and nuclear industries, advocates extracting hydrogen from fossil fuels and splitting it from water using nuclear power. Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club’s Global Warming and Energy Program, characterizes this approach as ""a nicotine patch that causes cancer.""",202,1019,376,215,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The Department of Energy estimates that Bush’s hydrogen fuel-cell initiatives could reduce demand for petroleum by 11 million barrels per day by 2040. But making gas-powered cars even slightly more efficient would achieve huge savings a whole lot sooner. If U.S. cars averaged a very achievable 40 miles a gallon, we could cut oil consumption by 4 million barrels per day right now—nearly as much as the United States imports from OPEC. —",202,1251,375,161,1,13

To level the economic playing field, the foundation suggests slapping a duty on imports from nations that refuse to ratify the protocol.

People in older houses with peeling paint are susceptible to lead poisoning; subsistence fishers pull PCB-laden fish out of industrial waterways.

A 44-pound child eating one six-ounce can of albacore per week would exceed the EPA’s safety standard by four times; a 132-pound woman by one and a half times. This March, the EPA and the FDA issued a strict new advisory, warning pregnant women, nursing mothers, women who may become pregnant, and young children not to eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish at all; to limit albacore to one meal per week; and closely watch local advisories about wild-caught fish.",202,5749,376,287,1,13

html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"In March, residents of rural Mendocino County, California, voted to ban genetically modified plants and animals from being grown or raised within county lines. The law is the first of its kind in the United States, but likely not the last, as recent studies confirm some of environmentalists’ worst fears about tinkering with nature.",202,8862,374,107,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Last November, agricultural economist Dr. Charles Benbrook published the first long-term study of pesticide use on corn, soybeans, and cotton genetically engineered to tolerate herbicides or to produce their own insecticides. Relying on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he found that pesticide application indeed declined during the first three years of commercial use—just as industry claimed it would. But in the last three years of the eight-year study period, pesticide use on genetically modified soybeans, the most common bioengineered crop, skyrocketed. Biotech cotton and corn registered small increases as well. Overall, pesticide use rose by 50 million pounds.",202,8986,375,233,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"The change, Benbrook says, is no surprise. ""Scientists have warned that heavy reliance on [herbicide-tolerant] crops might lead to changes in weed communities and resistance, in turn triggering the need to apply additional herbicides and/or increase rates of application,"" he writes in the study. ""These predictable ecological adaptations have now been documented.""",202,9236,366,125,1,13
html body text table tbody tr td table tbody tr td p span  ,"Perhaps equally predictable is the toll that increased herbicide use takes on ecosystems. Also last fall, scientists in Great Britain reported their findings from a government-funded study comparing biodiversity in fields growing conventional sugar beet, oilseed rape, and maize with those growing plants genetically modified for resistance to herbicides. With the beet and rape plants, the researchers found fewer seeds, flowering weeds, and insects—all important food sources for birds and other wildlife—in the bioengineered fields.",202,9378,374,179,1,13
