They asked the administrators questions about provisions they would usually allow in contracts between their medical schools and corporate sponsors.

html body text div div div div div p span  ,"In summary, this study suggests that some medical schools will acquiesce to contracts that prevent their faculty from having meaningful control over research projects for which they are the ostensible investigators. Some medical schools will allow corporate research sponsors to manipulate the design, analysis, and interpretation of results to increase the likelihood of getting the results the sponsor wants. For example, 50% of medical schools would allow the corporate sponsor to write manuscripts reporting on study results, and only allow faculty to ""suggest revisions."" Thus, many medical schools acquiesce to contracts that could allow corporate sponsors to ghost-write articles. Furthermore, more than half of the medical schools acquiesce to contracts that are kept confidential, preventing easy discovery of manipulation of the conduct and dissemination of the research by the corporate sponsor.",8,772,763,143,1,10

html body text div div div div div p span  ,"To underline the context, in my experience, to do clinical research, most medical school faculty are strongly pressured by their institutions to obtain external funding to support this work. Those who cannot obtain funding within a few years of unemployment often have to find something else to do other than research. However, although faculty are expected to find sources of funding, it is generally the medical schools or academic medical centers, not the researchers, who negotiate research agreements, and although such agreements may bind faculty members, the money paid under their auspices generally goes directly to the faculty member's employer. Thus, individual researchers are under considerable pressure to find grant and contract funding, and to keep their financial sponsors happy, but must work under whatever contract provisions their employers negotiate.",8,1002,756,143,1,10
html body text div div div div div p span  ,"The New England Journal of Medicine article clearly suggests that some medical schools allow researchers to be bound by agreements that allow the study's sponsor to manipulate study design, analysis, and interpretation to make it more likely that the results will be to the sponsor's liking. Since clinical trials enroll real human beings as subjects with the promise that the data they contribute, and the risks they run, will lead to valid scientific results, allowing such manipulation appears to not only likely to produce biased results, but also to be allow unethical exploitation of human subjects, and thus is in conflict with the medical school's scientific and humanitarian mission.",8,1162,766,107,1,10

I do blame the higher leadership of the medical schools for fostering a climate in which money is more important than doing valid, ethical research.

html body text div div div div ul li div p span  ,"This study builds on our 2002 work. Multicenter clinical trial research is governed by standard agreements at all sites participating in a study-there really is little variablity within a study, only some varaibility across studies. The final result is that when patients are randomized, the institution has not assuance that the sponsor will publish the overall trial results, not that there will be an independent process to assess whether in fact the trial is publishable. Since the definition of research is the creation of generalizable knowledge, site investigators at academic medical centers are in fact deceiving patients when they recruit them to multicenter clinical trials if they ask them to participate in a research study under current agreements. Even with the 2001 guidelines, the 2002 paper and now this paper, there looks to be little pressure to change practices. Further, we need a single ethical standard for research-otherwise trials will move to non-academic sites in the US or off-shore.",48,1823,728,161,1,12

On the other hand, physicians have to evaluate journal articles from non-randomized studies. These are the Wild, Wild West. Hundreds of questions can be asked and a few, most likely false positive, results are reported. No one can check anything as near as I can tell. Ask for study details like the SAS code used for the analysis or the raw data and most likely you will get stonewalled. Most of this research is government funded.
