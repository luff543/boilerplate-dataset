In this context, Muslim jurists formulated a legal principle known asSadd-u-Thara'ie, which means, in practical terms, closing the doors or removing the meanswhich lead to what is unlawful. This principle entails the prohibition of certainsubstances or activities for the simple reason that they would lead to a forbidden actionor behaviour. Some of these substances and activities might not be unlawful in themselves,but they become subject to prohibition when they can lead to some other activity that isexpressly forbidden.",8,42,769,90,1,7
