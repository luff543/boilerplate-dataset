html body text blockquote font p font span  ,"Probably the most documented covert arms-supply operation ever undertaken by a U.S. administration was the ""Iran-contra"" affair of the mid-1980s. This effort was initiated in 1981, when President Reagan signed a classified ""finding"" to the effect that U.S. security would be enhanced by providing covert support for paramilitary operations against ""the Cuban presence and Cuban-Sandinista support infrastructure in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America.""(5) Ultimately, this operation resulted in the delivery of millions of dollars’ worth of arms and ammunition to the anti-Sandinista insurgents in Nicaragua and, when the scheme was finally uncovered, in felony charges against senior officials of the Reagan Administration.(6)",48,2501,681,95,1,8
html body text blockquote font p font span  ,"In arming the contras, U.S. operatives generally sought weapons of Soviet or Eastern bloc manufacture, thereby allowing the insurgents to employ ammunition captured from the Sandinista army, which was largely equipped with Soviet-type weaponry. (The use of Soviet-type weapons also made it easier for the contras and their backers to claim that they were obtaining their arms from defectors or fallen Sandinista soldiers, rather than from the United States.) To obtain such arms, the CIA drew on a variety of sources. In May 1983, for instance, retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord, acting on behalf of CIA Director William Casey secretly obtained several tons of Soviet-type munitions that had been confiscated from PLO forces by the Israelis in 1982. These weapons, and additional ex-PLO munitions acquired from Israel in March-July 1984, were then transferred to the CIA and, through a variety of clandestine channels, passed on to the contras.(7)",48,2610,683,127,1,8
html body text blockquote font p font span  ,"Although the full extent of covert arms aid to the contras has never been established, the available documentation suggests that it was substantial. In one memo sent to CIA Director William Casey in July 1986, retired Major General John Singlaub (a key figure in the covert supply operation) discussed a pending delivery of 10,000 Kalashnikov AKM assault rifles, 200 RPG-7 rocket launchers, 200 60 mm mortars, 50 82 mm mortars, 60 12.7 mm machine guns, 50 SA-7 portable surface-to-air missiles, and related ammunition.(8) Other evidence of large arms shipments comes from the transcripts of radio communications between the contras and their contacts at the CIA. On April 12, 1986, for instance, a rebel field commander radioed a CIA official to acknowledge that his forces had just received an airdrop of 20,000 pounds of military equipment, including German-type G3 assault rifles, rifle magazines and ammunition, RPG-7 rockets, grenades, and grenade launchers.(9) Because supply operations of this type were conducted on a regular basis for several years, it is clear that substantial quantities of small arms and other light weapons were given to the contras during this period.",48,2751,683,159,1,8

html body text blockquote font p font span  ,"In addition to aiding the contras, the United States provided covert assistance to special intelligence organizations in Guatemala and Honduras during the 1980s and (in the case of Guatemala) the early 1990s. These units—the D-2 branch of the Guatemalan military and Battalion 316 of the Honduran military—were responsible for identifying and, in many cases, murdering members of opposition political movements. Typically, the victims of these agencies were beaten, tortured, and then ""disappeared""—that is, executed in secret, with their remains hidden in unmarked burial sites. While condemning such behavior in public, the Reagan and Bush Administrations secretly approved the transfer of CIA funds and equipment to these units on the premise that their assistance was needed in the struggle to wipe out communism in Central America.(10) Later, when the Cold War drew to a close, the United States continued its support—estimated at $3-5 million per year—for the Guatemalan D-2, in order (it was claimed) to obtain information on illicit drug trafficking in the region.(11)",48,3001,687,143,1,8

In-bond cargo containers typically remain sealed as they move from ship to truck to border.

For instance, in 1997 several defendants were indicted for attempting to export illegally 53 AR-15 rifles from the United States to Colombia. In another case in 1997, Customs blocked an attempt to import surface to air missiles from Bulgaria for transhipment to Colombia.

html body text blockquote font p font span  ,"The Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 (sponsored by the National Rifle Association) requires that multiple sales be reported to the BATF and local law enforcement agencies, so that they can monitor multiple gun purchases and investigate if they suspect criminal intent. But currently only three states—Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina—have laws that prevent people from buying more than one gun a month. In all other states, straw purchasers can buy significant quantities of guns and ammunition from gun dealers at one time and pass them on to smugglers for clandestine shipment. A 1991 BATF report describes a number of such transactions, including a 1989 case in which three Arizona residents purchased 93 assault rifles and 22 handguns for a well known Mexican narcotics trafficker, who then smuggled them into Mexico.(18)",48,3893,686,111,1,8
html body text blockquote font p font span  ,"U.S. and foreign military depots are another likely source of black-market arms supply. In 1993, the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that small arms parts were routinely stolen from a number of U.S. military repair shops and warehouses. The parts were then sold to gun dealers or to walk-in customers at gun shows around the United States. GAO investigators were able to purchase military small arms parts at 13 of 15 gun shows they visited. They were able to buy everything needed to convert a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle into a fully automatic M16, as well as 30-round M16 magazine clips still in their original packages.(19) Given the paucity of end-use checks performed on U.S.-supplied arms (see table 1), it is reasonable to assume that theft of U.S.-supplied small arms from depots in Central America contributes to the black market in arms, as well.",48,4018,684,111,1,8
